	abstract = {This paper presents a data‐driven framework for the development of reduced‐order models to predict microstructure‐sensitive effective thermal conductivity of woven ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) with residual porosity. The main components of the proposed framework include (i) digital generation of representative volume elements (RVEs), (ii) estimation of the effective thermal conductivities of the RVEs using ﬁnite element (FE) models, (iii) low dimensional representation of the microstructure in the RVEs using 2‐point spatial correlations and principal component analysis (PCA), and (iv) an active learning strategy based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) that minimizes the size of the training dataset through the selection of microstructures with the highest potential for information gain. The reduced‐order models are demonstrated to provide high ﬁdelity predictions on new RVEs.},

	abstract = {The temperature, stress, and environmental conditions of many gas turbine, hypersonic,
and even nuclear applications make the use of woven SiC/SiC composites an attractive
enabling material system. The development in SiC/SiC composites over the past few
years has resulted in significant advances in high temperature performance so that now
these materials are being pursued for several turbine airfoil and reusable
hypersonic applications. The keys to maximizing stress capability and maximizing
temperature capability will be outlined for SiC/SiC. These include the type of SiC fiber,
the fiber-architecture, and the matrix processing approach which leads to a variety
of matrix compositions and structure. It will also be shown that a range of mechanical,
thermal, and permeability properties can be attained and tailored depending on the
needs of an application. Finally, some of the remaining challenges will be discussed in
order for the use of these composite systems to be fully realized.},
