	abstract = {Forecasting stochastic nonlinear dynamical systems under the influence of conditioning variables is a fundamental challenge repeatedly encountered across the biological and physical sciences. While flow-based models can impressively predict the temporal evolution of probability distributions representing possible outcomes of a specific process, existing frameworks cannot satisfactorily account for the impact of conditioning variables on these dynamics. Amongst several limitations, existing methods require training data with paired conditions and are developed for discrete conditioning variables. We propose Conditional Variable Flow Matching (CVFM), a framework for learning flows transforming conditional distributions with amortization across continuous conditioning variables - permitting predictions across the conditional density manifold. This is accomplished through several novel advances. In particular, simultaneous sample conditioned flows over the main and conditioning variables. In addition, motivated by theoretical analysis, a conditional Wasserstein distance combined with a loss reweighting kernel facilitating conditional optimal transport. Collectively, these advances allow for learning system dynamics provided measurement data whose states and conditioning variables are not in correspondence. We demonstrate CVFM on a suite of increasingly challenging problems, including discrete and continuous conditional mapping benchmarks, image-to-image domain transfer, and modeling the temporal evolution of materials internal structure during manufacturing processes. We observe that CVFM results in improved performance and convergence characteristics over alternative conditional variants.},

However, these new opportunities are accompanied by a drastic increase in the required amount of training data. This is in stark juxtaposition to the high expense and difficulty in curating such large materials datasets. In this work, we propose a novel framework for integrating generative models within an active learning loop. This enables the training of generative models with datasets significantly smaller than what has previously been demonstrated, providing a direct route for their application in data constrained environments. The functionality of this framework is then demonstrated by addressing the challenge of designing polycrystalline textures associated with target anisotropic mechanical properties. The developed protocol exhibited a cost reduction between 14 to 18 times over a randomly sampled experimental design.},

	abstract = {The availability of large, diverse datasets has enabled transformative advances in a wide variety of technical fields by unlocking data scientific and machine learning techniques. In Materials Informatics for Heterogeneous Microstructures capitalization on these techniques has been limited due to the extreme complexity of generating or curating sizeable heterogeneous microstructure datasets. Historically, this difficulty can be attributed to two main hurdles: quantification (i.e., measuring microstructure diversity) and curation (i.e., generating diverse microstructures). In this paper, we present a framework for curating large, statistically diverse mesoscale microstructure datasets composed of 2-phase microstructures. The framework generates microstructures which are statistically diverse with respect to their n-point statistics—the primary emphasis is on diversity in their 2-point statistics. The framework’s foundation is a proposed set of algorithms for synthesizing salient 2-point statistics and neighborhood distributions. We generate statistically diverse microstructures by using the outputs of these algorithms as inputs to a statistically conditioned Local-Global Decomposition generation procedure. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed framework by curating MICRO2D, a diverse, large-scale, and open source heterogeneous microstructure dataset comprised of 87, 379 2-phase microstructures. The contained microstructures are periodic and \$\$256 {\textbackslash}times 256\$\$pixels. The dataset also contains salient homogenized elastic and thermal properties computed across a range of constituent contrast ratios for each microstructure. Using MICRO2D, we analyze the statistical and property diversity achievable via the proposed framework. We conclude by discussing important areas of future research in microstructure dataset curation.},

	abstract = {Additive manufacturing is increasingly being employed to produce components of complex geometries in structural alloys because of the expected energy savings associated with the near-net-shape capability and the ability to build in novel internal features that are not possible with many conventional manufacturing approaches. However, because of the extreme thermal conditions encountered, the non-equilibrium microstructures produced during powder bed-based additive manufacturing processes must be subjected to custom post-heat treatment processes to recover the target mechanical properties. Phase-field models and simulation techniques have matured to a state where the microstructure evolution paths, and the morphologies of the resulting precipitate phases can be predicted reasonably accurately, considering alloy-specific thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the nucleation and growth processes. However, phase-field simulations are computationally intensive, which precludes the ability to apply the simulations directly to the length scale of the entire component. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop low-computational-cost surrogate models that effectively capture the physics at the microstructural length scale, while facilitating the design of optimized processing conditions resulting in location-specific targeted microstructures at the component scale. The work presented here demonstrates the application of the materials knowledge system framework to develop a surrogate model that effectively captures the microstructural path during annealing of a Ni–Mo–Nb alloy containing different Mo and Nb compositions known to segregate during solidification under additive manufacturing conditions. Specifically, the surrogate model built in this work is based on a Gaussian process autoregressive model informed by statistical representation of simulated microstructures using two-point correlations and dimensionality reduction through principal component analysis. This surrogate model is shown to capture the bifurcation of the microstructural path during precipitation, which yields a microstructure dominated by the \$\$\{{\textbackslash}gamma \}{\textasciicircum}\{\{{\textbackslash}prime\}\{{\textbackslash}prime\}\}\$\$phase at high Nb concentrations and the \$\${\textbackslash}delta\$\$phase at low Nb concentrations.},

	abstract = {Inverse problems are central to material design. While numerous studies have focused on designing microstructures by inverting structure-property linkages for various material systems, such efforts stop short of providing realizable paths to manufacture such structures. Accomplishing the dual task of designing a microstructure and a feasible manufacturing pathway to achieve a target property requires inverting the complete process-structure-property linkage. However, this inversion is complicated by a variety of challenges such as inherent microstructure stochasticity, high-dimensionality, and ill-conditioning of the inversion. In this work, we propose a Bayesian framework leveraging a lightweight flow-based generative approach for the stochastic inversion of the complete process-structure-property linkage. This inversion identifies a solution distribution in the processing parameter space; utilizing these processing conditions realizes materials with the target property sets. Our modular framework readily incorporates the output of stochastic forward models as conditioning variables for a flow-based generative model, thereby learning the complete joint distribution over processing parameters and properties. We demonstrate its application to the multi-objective task of designing processing routes of heterogeneous materials given target sets of bulk elastic moduli and thermal conductivities.},

However, prior frameworks have struggled to address this problem’s unique combination of challenges: the high dimensionality and stochasticity of microstructures, under sampled initial datasets, and ill-conditioning of the inversion. In this work, we propose a computational framework for Inverse Microstructure Design problems using a Bayesian methodology. We construct this framework from three modular components, enabling flexible extension and re-use. First, we define a low-dimensional, informative microstructure prior by integrating domain knowledge (i.e., statistical continuum mechanics) into a distributional learning scheme. This scheme includes multiple latent representations which address the challenges inherent to representing microstructures. Second, we define a property-specific likelihood using a multi-output Gaussian process regression surrogate model. Finally, we efficiently learn the conditional posterior density for a given target property, and generate samples using deep variational inference. We demonstrate our proposed method for solving stochastic microstructure design problems by identifying woven ceramic matrix composites matching target anisotropic thermal conductivities. Through this example, we analyze the integral role of each component in the inversion framework.},

Such an approach is wholly unsuitable for a variety of material classes, such as ceramic matrix composites, which exhibit large variability at multiple length-scales. This work demonstrates a framework for approaching two open problems towards improved microstructuresensitive predictions, namely, (i) probabilistically calibrating complex constitutive models at the mesoscale to sparsely observed macroscale experimental data, and (ii) propagating this stochastic constituent behavior at the mesoscale towards low-cost homogenized predictions for unseen microstructures. The proposed stochastic scale-bridging framework displays a continuity of information ﬂow where no portion of the experimental data is neglected out of convenience, facilitating the greatest information gain from oftentimes costly experiments. In this paper, suitable protocols were developed to address the challenges described above. The protocols were subsequently demonstrated on ceramic matrix composite’s uniaxial tensile stress–strain response, where constituent behavior at the mesoscale was described using continuum damage mechanics, and predictions encapsulating constitutive model parameter uncertainty were made for novel microstructures. The methodology presented in this work is broadly applicable to various material classes and constitutive models with high-dimensional parameter sets.},
