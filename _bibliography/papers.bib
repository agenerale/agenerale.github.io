	abstract = {Inverse Microstructure Design problems are ubiquitous in materials science; for example, property-driven microstructure design requires the inversion of a structure--property linkage. However, prior frameworks have struggled to address this problem's unique combination of challenges: the high dimensionality and stochasticity of microstructures, under sampled initial datasets, and ill-conditioning of the inversion. In this work, we propose a computational framework for Inverse Microstructure Design problems using a Bayesian methodology. We construct this framework from three modular components, enabling flexible extension and re-use. First, we define a low-dimensional, informative microstructure prior by integrating domain knowledge (i.e., statistical continuum mechanics) into a distributional learning scheme. This scheme includes multiple latent representations which address the challenges inherent to representing microstructures. Second, we define a property-specific likelihood using a multi-output Gaussian process regression surrogate model. Finally, we efficiently learn the conditional posterior density for a given target property, and generate samples using deep variational inference. We demonstrate our proposed method for solving stochastic microstructure design problems by identifying woven ceramic matrix composites matching target anisotropic thermal conductivities. Through this example, we analyze the integral role of each component in the inversion framework.},

	abstract = {Hierarchical multiscale modeling of heterogeneous materials has traditionally relied upon a deterministic estimation of constitutive properties when making microstructure-sensitive predictions of effective response at each subsequent length-scale. Such an approach is wholly unsuitable for a variety of material classes, such as ceramic matrix composites, which exhibit large variability at multiple length-scales. This work demonstrates a framework for approaching two open problems towards improved microstructuresensitive predictions, namely, (i) probabilistically calibrating complex constitutive models at the mesoscale to sparsely observed macroscale experimental data, and (ii) propagating this stochastic constituent behavior at the mesoscale towards low-cost homogenized predictions for unseen microstructures. The proposed stochastic scale-bridging framework displays a continuity of information ﬂow where no portion of the experimental data is neglected out of convenience, facilitating the greatest information gain from oftentimes costly experiments. In this paper, suitable protocols were developed to address the challenges described above. The protocols were subsequently demonstrated on ceramic matrix composite’s uniaxial tensile stress–strain response, where constituent behavior at the mesoscale was described using continuum damage mechanics, and predictions encapsulating constitutive model parameter uncertainty were made for novel microstructures. The methodology presented in this work is broadly applicable to various material classes and constitutive models with high-dimensional parameter sets.},

Spe­ cifically, this work demonstrates a successful application of Bayesian inference for the simultaneous estimation of eleven material parameters of a viscous multimode CDM model conditioned upon a small inhomogeneous multiaxial experimental dataset. The stochastic treatment of CDM model parameters provides uncertainty esti­ mates, enables the propagation of uncertainty into further analyses, and provides for principled decision making regarding informative subsequent experimental tests of value. The methodology presented in this work is also broadly applicable to various mechanical models with high-dimensional parameter sets.},
