	abstract = {The calibration of continuum damage mechanics (CDM) models is often performed by least-squares regression through the design of specifically crafted experiments to identify a deterministic solution of model parameters minimizing the squared error between the model prediction and the corresponding experimental result. Spe­ cifically, this work demonstrates a successful application of Bayesian inference for the simultaneous estimation of eleven material parameters of a viscous multimode CDM model conditioned upon a small inhomogeneous multiaxial experimental dataset. The stochastic treatment of CDM model parameters provides uncertainty esti­ mates, enables the propagation of uncertainty into further analyses, and provides for principled decision making regarding informative subsequent experimental tests of value. The methodology presented in this work is also broadly applicable to various mechanical models with high-dimensional parameter sets.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a data‐driven framework for the development of reduced‐order models to predict microstructure‐sensitive effective thermal conductivity of woven ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) with residual porosity. The main components of the proposed framework include (i) digital generation of representative volume elements (RVEs), (ii) estimation of the effective thermal conductivities of the RVEs using ﬁnite element (FE) models, (iii) low dimensional representation of the microstructure in the RVEs using 2‐point spatial correlations and principal component analysis (PCA), and (iv) an active learning strategy based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) that minimizes the size of the training dataset through the selection of microstructures with the highest potential for information gain. The reduced‐order models are demonstrated to provide high ﬁdelity predictions on new RVEs.},
