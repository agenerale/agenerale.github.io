However, the lack of computationally efficient and statistically rigorous descriptors for such defect systems has hindered the development and adoption of rational protocols for the optimal design of these material systems. This study presents a framework for the rigorous statistical quantification and low-dimensional representation of dislocation structures using the formalism of 2-point statistics (also called 2-point spatial correlations) along with principal component analysis. The usefulness of this basic framework for comparing and observing dislocation structures is exemplified and discussed with suitable examples.},

Despite the paramount importance of microstructure to the field a rigorous systematic framework for the description of structural variance between samples of materials with the same processing history and between different materials classes has yet to be adopted. Here the authors utilize the formalism of stochastic processes to develop a statistical definition of microstructure and develop measures of structural variance in terms of the measured variance of estimators of higher order probability distributions. Principal component analysis (PCA) of higher order distributions is used to produce visualization of the space spanned by an ensemble of microstructure realizations and for quantification of the structural variance within the ensemble. The structural variance is correlated with the variance in properties and structure/property maps are produced in the PCA space.},

	abstract = {We introduce a denoising diffusion algorithm to discover microstructures with nonlinear fine-tuned properties. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models are generative models that use diffusion-based dynamics to gradually denoise images and generate realistic synthetic samples. By learning the reverse of a Markov diffusion process, we design an artificial intelligence to efficiently manipulate the topology of microstructures to generate a massive number of prototypes that exhibit constitutive responses sufficiently close to designated nonlinear constitutive behaviors. To identify the subset of microcstructures with sufficiently precise fine-tuned properties, a convolutional neural network surrogate is trained to replace high-fidelity finite element simulations to filter out prototypes outside the admissible range. Results of this study indicate that the denoising diffusion process is capable of creating microstructures of fine-tuned nonlinear material properties within the latent space of the training data. More importantly, this denoising diffusion algorithm can be easily extended to incorporate additional topological and geometric modifications by introducing high-dimensional structures embedded in the latent space. Numerical experiments are conducted on the open-source mechanical MNIST data set (Lejeune, 2020). Consequently, this algorithm is not only capable of performing inverse design of nonlinear effective media, but also learns the nonlinear structure–property map to quantitatively understand the multiscale interplay among the geometry, topology, and their effective macroscopic properties.},

We introduce beta-VAE, a new state-of-the-art framework for automated discovery of interpretable factorised latent representations from raw image data in a completely unsupervised manner. Our approach is a modification of the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework. We introduce an adjustable hyperparameter beta that balances latent channel capacity and independence constraints with reconstruction accuracy. We demonstrate that beta-VAE with appropriately tuned beta {\textgreater} 1 qualitatively outperforms VAE (beta = 1), as well as state of the art unsupervised (InfoGAN) and semi-supervised (DC-IGN) approaches to disentangled factor learning on a variety of datasets (celebA, faces and chairs). Furthermore, we devise a protocol to quantitatively compare the degree of disentanglement learnt by different models, and show that our approach also significantly outperforms all baselines quantitatively. Unlike InfoGAN, beta-VAE is stable to train, makes few assumptions about the data and relies on tuning a single hyperparameter, which can be directly optimised through a hyper parameter search using weakly labelled data or through heuristic visual inspection for purely unsupervised data.},

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

	abstract = {Conditional microstructure generation tools offer an important, inexpensive pathway to constructing statistically diverse datasets for Integrated Computational Materials Engineering and Materials Informatics efforts. To provide this utility in practice, an ideal generative framework must be able to efficiently, systematically, and robustly generate microstructures corresponding to selected spatial statistics (e.g., 1- and 2-point statistics) while also producing realistic local features (e.g., shapes and sizes of individual phase constituents). Because of the austerity of these requirements, generative frameworks often target either statistical conditioning or visual realism, but not both. In this paper, we propose to bridge these two approaches by approximating a microstructure’s generating process (i.e., its stochastic microstructure function) using a two layer semi-directed probabilistic graphical model. The first layer – a Gaussian Random Field (GRF) – provides direct control of the 1- and 2-point statistics. The second layer – a Score Based Generative Deep Learning model – postprocesses GRF predictions to refine local features while preserving global patterning. To understand and evaluate our proposed framework, we apply it to generate statistically equivalent N-phase microstructures from experimental references, including a 2-Phase Nickel-based Super Alloy and a 3-phase α−β Titanium alloy. Through these two case studies, we demonstrate that our framework successfully matches both lower-order (1- and 2-point statistics) and several salient higher-order statistics. Additionally, we briefly explore the capacity of these models to extrapolate outside of their training data by varying the input 2-point statistics. We discuss the value of this ability towards systematically generating diverse microstructure datasets.},

	abstract = {The variational framework for learning inducing variables (Titsias, 2009a) has had a large impact on the Gaussian process literature. The framework may be interpreted as minimizing a rigorously defined Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximating and posterior processes. To our knowledge this connection has thus far gone unremarked in the literature. In this paper we give a substantial generalization of the literature on this topic. We give a new proof of the result for infinite index sets which allows inducing points that are not data points and likelihoods that depend on all function values. We then discuss augmented index sets and show that, contrary to previous works, marginal consistency of augmentation is not enough to guarantee consistency of variational inference with the original model. We then characterize an extra condition where such a guarantee is obtainable. Finally we show how our framework sheds light on interdomain sparse approximations and sparse approximations for Cox processes.},

A neural network pretrained in this way can then, without additional training or optimization, infer full posteriors on arbitrarily many real data sets involving the same model family. In addition, our method incorporates a summary network trained to embed the observed data into maximally informative summary statistics. Learning summary statistics from data makes the method applicable to modeling scenarios where standard inference techniques with handcrafted summary statistics fail. We demonstrate the utility of BayesFlow on challenging intractable models from population dynamics, epidemiology, cognitive science, and ecology. We argue that BayesFlow provides a general framework for building amortized Bayesian parameter estimation machines for any forward model from which data can be simulated.},

            Bayesian optimal design of experiments (BODEs) have been successful in acquiring information about a quantity of interest (QoI) which depends on a black-box function. BODE is characterized by sequentially querying the function at specific designs selected by an infill-sampling criterion. However, most current BODE methods operate in specific contexts like optimization, or learning a universal representation of the black-box function. The objective of this paper is to design a BODE for estimating the statistical expectation of a physical response surface. This QoI is omnipresent in uncertainty propagation and design under uncertainty problems. Our hypothesis is that an optimal BODE should be maximizing the expected information gain in the QoI. We represent the information gain from a hypothetical experiment as the Kullback–Liebler (KL) divergence between the prior and the posterior probability distributions of the QoI. The prior distribution of the QoI is conditioned on the observed data, and the posterior distribution of the QoI is conditioned on the observed data and a hypothetical experiment. The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of a semi-analytic mathematical formula for the expected information gain about the statistical expectation of a physical response. The developed BODE is validated on synthetic functions with varying number of input-dimensions. We demonstrate the performance of the methodology on a steel wire manufacturing problem.},

	abstract = {The popularity of Bayesian optimization methods for eﬃcient exploration of parameter spaces has lead to a series of papers applying Gaussian processes as surrogates in the optimization of functions. However, most proposed approaches only allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often, it is desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to explore. This is particularly the case when large parallel processing facilities are available. These could either be computational or physical facets of the process being optimized. Batch methods, however, require the modeling of the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate this issue and propose a highly eﬀective heuristic based on an estimate of the function’s Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interaction—local repulsion—at negligible computational overhead. A penalized acquisition function is used to collect batches of points minimizing the non-parallelizable computational effort. The resulting algorithm compares very well, in run-time, with much more elaborate alternatives.},

	title = {Score-based {Generative} {Modeling} {Through} {Stochastic} {Differential} {Equations}},
	abstract = {Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient ﬁeld (a.k.a., score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efﬁciency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high ﬁdelity generation of 1024 ˆ 1024 images for the ﬁrst time from a score-based generative model.},

Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching (FM), a simulation-free approach for training CNFs based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples—which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training CNFs using Flow Matching on ImageNet leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical ODE solvers.},

Our evaluation study shows that the performance of the resulting models exceeds that of models trained with other common regularisers.

However, these approaches require a two-stage training pipeline with a well-trained teacher network and can only produce natural sound by using probability distillation along with auxiliary loss terms. We propose FloWaveNet, a flow-based generative model for raw audio synthesis. FloWaveNet requires only a single-stage training procedure and a single maximum likelihood loss, without any additional auxiliary terms, and it is inherently parallel due to the characteristics of generative flow. The model can efficiently sample raw audio in real-time, with clarity comparable to previous two-stage parallel models.

We thoroughly investigate the two methods for regression both analytically and through illustrative examples, and draw conclusions to guide practical application.},

	abstract = {The vast quantity of information brought by big data as well as the evolving computer hardware encourages success stories in the machine learning community. In the meanwhile, it poses challenges for the Gaussian process (GP) regression, a well-known non-parametric and interpretable Bayesian model, which suffers from cubic complexity to data size. To improve the scalability while retaining desirable prediction quality, a variety of scalable GPs have been presented. But they have not yet been comprehensively reviewed and analyzed in order to be well understood by both academia and industry. The review of scalable GPs in the GP community is timely and important due to the explosion of data size. To this end, this paper is devoted to the review on state-of-the-art scalable GPs involving two main categories: global approximations which distillate the entire data and local approximations which divide the data for subspace learning. Particularly, for global approximations, we mainly focus on sparse approximations comprising prior approximations which modify the prior but perform exact inference, posterior approximations which retain exact prior but perform approximate inference, and structured sparse approximations which exploit speciﬁc structures in kernel matrix; for local approximations, we highlight the mixture/product of experts that conducts model averaging from multiple local experts to boost predictions. To present a complete review, recent advances for improving the scalability and capability of scalable GPs are reviewed. Finally, the extensions and open issues regarding the implementation of scalable GPs in various scenarios are reviewed and discussed to inspire novel ideas for future research avenues.},

This article provides a basic introduction to MCMC methods by establishing a strong conceptual understanding of what problems MCMC methods are trying to solve, why we want to use them, and how they work in theory and in practice. To develop these concepts, I outline the foundations of Bayesian inference, discuss how posterior distributions are used in practice, explore basic approaches to estimate posterior-based quantities, and derive their link to Monte Carlo sampling and MCMC. Using a simple toy problem, I then demonstrate how these concepts can be used to understand the benefits and drawbacks of various MCMC approaches.

	abstract = {Hierarchical multiscale modeling of heterogeneous materials has traditionally relied upon a deterministic estimation of constitutive properties when making microstructure-sensitive predictions of effective response at each subsequent length-scale. Such an approach is wholly unsuitable for a variety of material classes, such as ceramic matrix composites, which exhibit large variability at multiple length-scales. This work demonstrates a framework for approaching two open problems towards improved microstructuresensitive predictions, namely, (i) probabilistically calibrating complex constitutive models at the mesoscale to sparsely observed macroscale experimental data, and (ii) propagating this stochastic constituent behavior at the mesoscale towards low-cost homogenized predictions for unseen microstructures. The proposed stochastic scale-bridging framework displays a continuity of information ﬂow where no portion of the experimental data is neglected out of convenience, facilitating the greatest information gain from oftentimes costly experiments. In this paper, suitable protocols were developed to address the challenges described above. The protocols were subsequently demonstrated on ceramic matrix composite’s uniaxial tensile stress–strain response, where constituent behavior at the mesoscale was described using continuum damage mechanics, and predictions encapsulating constitutive model parameter uncertainty were made for novel microstructures. The methodology presented in this work is broadly applicable to various material classes and constitutive models with high-dimensional parameter sets.},

The proposed flow consists of a chain of invertible transformations, where each transformation is based on an autoregressive neural network. In experiments, we show that IAF significantly improves upon diagonal Gaussian approximate posteriors. In addition, we demonstrate that a novel type of variational autoencoder, coupled with IAF, is competitive with neural autoregressive models in terms of attained log-likelihood on natural images, while allowing significantly faster synthesis.},

We first derive Variational Diffusion Models (VDM) as a special case of a Markovian Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder, where three key assumptions enable tractable computation and scalable optimization of the ELBO. We then prove that optimizing a VDM boils down to learning a neural network to predict one of three potential objectives: the original source input from any arbitrary noisification of it, the original source noise from any arbitrarily noisified input, or the score function of a noisified input at any arbitrary noise level. We then dive deeper into what it means to learn the score function, and connect the variational perspective of a diffusion model explicitly with the Score-based Generative Modeling perspective through Tweedie's Formula. Lastly, we cover how to learn a conditional distribution using diffusion models via guidance.},

	abstract = {This paper has two aims, one fairly concrete and the other more abstract. In Section 3, bounds are obtained under certain conditions for the departure of the distribution of the sum of n terms of a stationary random sequence from a normal distribution. These bounds are derived from a more abstract normal approximation theorem proved in Section 2. I regret that, in order to complete this paper in time for publication, I have been forced to submit it with many defects remaining. In particular the proof of the concrete results of Section 3 is somewhat incomplete. A well known theorem of A. Berry [1] and C-G. Esseen [2] asserts that if X1, X2, . is a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables with EXi = 0, EXV = 1, and ,B = EIXij3 {\textless} oo. then the cumulative distribution function of (1//;n) Yi=l Xi differs from the unit normal distribution by at most Kf3/ n where K is a constant, which can be taken to be 2. It seems likely, but has never been proved and will not be proved here, that a similar result holds for stationary sequences in which the dependence falls off sufficiently rapidly and the variance of(1//;n) X1.1 Xi approaches a positive constant. I. Ibragimov and Yu. Linnik ([3], pp. 423-432) prove that, under these conditions, the limiting distribution of (1/ /n) E Xi is normal with mean 0 and a certain variance G2 Perhaps the best published results on bounds for the error are those of Phillip [5]. who shows that if in addition the Xi are bounded, with exponentially decreasing dependence, then the discrepancy is roughly of the order of n-114 In Corollary 3.2 of the present paper it is proved that under these conditions the discrepancy is of the order of n 1/2(log n)2. Actually the assumption of boundedness is weakened to the finiteness of eighth moments. In Corollary 3.1 it is proved that if the assumption of exponential decrease of dependence is strengthened tormdependence, the error in the normal approximation is of the order of n1/2 The abstract normal approximation theorem of Section 2 is elementary in the sense that it uses only the basic properties of conditional expectation and the elements of analysis, including the solution of a first order linear differential equation.

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2110.06197},
	abstract = {Generating the periodic structure of stable materials is a long-standing challenge for the material design community. This task is difficult because stable materials only exist in a low-dimensional subspace of all possible periodic arrangements of atoms: 1) the coordinates must lie in the local energy minimum defined by quantum mechanics, and 2) global stability also requires the structure to follow the complex, yet specific bonding preferences between different atom types. Existing methods fail to incorporate these factors and often lack proper invariances. We propose a Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE) that captures the physical inductive bias of material stability. By learning from the data distribution of stable materials, the decoder generates materials in a diffusion process that moves atomic coordinates towards a lower energy state and updates atom types to satisfy bonding preferences between neighbors. Our model also explicitly encodes interactions across periodic boundaries and respects permutation, translation, rotation, and periodic invariances. We significantly outperform past methods in three tasks: 1) reconstructing the input structure, 2) generating valid, diverse, and realistic materials, and 3) generating materials that optimize a specific property. We also provide several standard datasets and evaluation metrics for the broader machine learning community.},

We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity of exact GP inference from O(n{\textasciicircum}3) to O(n{\textasciicircum}2). Adapting this algorithm to scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations. Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of optimizing combinatorial spaces (e.g., sequences, trees, and graphs) using expensive black-box function evaluations. For example, optimizing molecules for drug design using physical lab experiments. Bayesian optimization (BO) is an efficient framework for solving such problems by intelligently selecting the inputs with high utility guided by a learned surrogate model. A recent BO approach for combinatorial spaces is through a reduction to BO over continuous spaces by learning a latent representation of structures using deep generative models (DGMs). The selected input from the continuous space is decoded into a discrete structure for performing function evaluation. However, the surrogate model over the latent space only uses the information learned by the DGM, which may not have the desired inductive bias to approximate the target black-box function. To overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a principled approach referred as LADDER. The key idea is to define a novel structure-coupled kernel that explicitly integrates the structural information from decoded structures with the learned latent space representation for better surrogate modeling. Our experiments on real-world benchmarks show that LADDER significantly improves over the BO over latent space method, and performs better or similar to state-of-the-art methods.},

Residual stress-induced shifts on the resonant frequencies were explicitly accounted for during the Bayesian inference, enabling the estimation of their effect on the resonant frequencies without a stress-relief heat treatment. Additively manufactured cobalt-nickel-base superalloy (SB-CoNi-10C) specimens were sectioned at multiple inclinations relative to the build direction and scanned with resonant ultrasound spectroscopy to demonstrate characterization of any arbitrarily textured cubic microstructure through the resonant frequencies. The orientation distribution function coefficients of the textured polycrystalline microstructure were estimated in tensorial form to calculate both the 2nd order Hashin-Shtrikman bounds and the self-consistent estimate of the elastic constants, enabling accurate determination of all 21 possible independent elastic constants through the convergence constraints of the texture.

	abstract = {The manifold hypothesis states that high-dimensional data can be modeled as lying on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) approximate this manifold by learning mappings from low-dimensional latent vectors to high-dimensional data while encouraging a global structure in the latent space through the use of a specified prior distribution. When this prior does not match the structure of the true data manifold, it can lead to a less accurate model of the data. To resolve this mismatch, we introduce the Variational Autoencoder with Learned Latent Structure (VAELLS) which incorporates a learnable manifold model into the latent space of a VAE. This enables us to learn the nonlinear manifold structure from the data and use that structure to define a prior in the latent space. The integration of a latent manifold model not only ensures that our prior is well-matched to the data, but also allows us to define generative transformation paths in the latent space and describe class manifolds with transformations stemming from examples of each class. We validate our model on examples with known latent structure and also demonstrate its capabilities on a real-world dataset.},

The VAE objective consists of two terms, (i) reconstruction and (ii) KL regularization, balanced by a weighting hyper-parameter {\textbackslash}beta. One notorious training difficulty is that the KL term tends to vanish. In this paper we study scheduling schemes for {\textbackslash}beta, and show that KL vanishing is caused by the lack of good latent codes in training the decoder at the beginning of optimization. To remedy this, we propose a cyclical annealing schedule, which repeats the process of increasing {\textbackslash}beta multiple times. This new procedure allows the progressive learning of more meaningful latent codes, by leveraging the informative representations of previous cycles as warm re-starts. The effectiveness of cyclical annealing is validated on a broad range of NLP tasks, including language modeling, dialog response generation and unsupervised language pre-training.},

The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

	abstract = {Computational image reconstruction algorithms generally produce a single image without any measure of uncertainty or confidence. Regularized Maximum Likelihood (RML) and feed-forward deep learning approaches for inverse problems typically focus on recovering a point estimate. This is a serious limitation when working with under-determined imaging systems, where it is conceivable that multiple image modes would be consistent with the measured data. Characterizing the space of probable images that explain the observational data is therefore crucial. In this paper, we propose a variational deep probabilistic imaging approach to quantify reconstruction uncertainty. Deep Probabilistic Imaging (DPI) employs an untrained deep generative model to estimate a posterior distribution of an unobserved image. This approach does not require any training data; instead, it optimizes the weights of a neural network to generate image samples that fit a particular measurement dataset. Once the network weights have been learned, the posterior distribution can be efficiently sampled. We demonstrate this approach in the context of interferometric radio imaging, which is used for black hole imaging with the Event Horizon Telescope, and compressed sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).},

	abstract = {Inference is crucial in modern astronomical research, where hidden astrophysical features and patterns are often estimated from indirect and noisy measurements. Inferring the posterior of hidden features, conditioned on the observed measurements, is essential for understanding the uncertainty of results and downstream scientific interpretations. Traditional approaches for posterior estimation include sampling-based methods and variational inference (VI). However, sampling-based methods are typically slow for high-dimensional inverse problems, while VI often lacks estimation accuracy. In this paper, we propose α-deep probabilistic inference, a deep learning framework that first learns an approximate posterior using α-divergence VI paired with a generative neural network, and then produces more accurate posterior samples through importance reweighting of the network samples. It inherits strengths from both sampling and VI methods: it is fast, accurate, and more scalable to high-dimensional problems than conventional sampling-based approaches. We apply our approach to two high-impact astronomical inference problems using real data: exoplanet astrometry and black hole feature extraction.},

            After a decade of periodic truss-, plate-, and shell-based architectures having dominated the design of metamaterials, we introduce the non-periodic class of spinodoid topologies. Inspired by natural self-assembly processes, spinodoid metamaterials are a close approximation of microstructures observed during spinodal phase separation. Their theoretical parametrization is so intriguingly simple that one can bypass costly phase-field simulations and obtain a rich and seamlessly tunable property space. Counter-intuitively, breaking with the periodicity of classical metamaterials is the enabling factor to the large property space and the ability to introduce seamless functional grading. We introduce an efficient and robust machine learning technique for the inverse design of (meta-)materials which, when applied to spinodoid topologies, enables us to generate uniform and functionally graded cellular mechanical metamaterials with tailored direction-dependent (anisotropic) stiffness and density. We specifically present biomimetic artificial bone architectures that not only reproduce the properties of trabecular bone accurately but also even geometrically resemble natural bone.},

	abstract = {The properties of individual phases and complex interactions of phases that affect mechanical behavior of metastable lamellar and Widmanstaetten morphologies of α+β Titanium alloys has long eluded quantitative assessment. As a result, the uncertainty of models for these complex multiphase morphologies is high, despite their importance in practical high-value applications. In this work, we present a comprehensive three-step framework for the estimation of intrinsic single crystal properties and the assessment of model plausibility for crystal plasticity models of lamellar α+β colonies of Titanium alloys using a dataset of experimentally obtained nanoindentation measurements on multiple grains in a polycrystalline sample. This approach does not rely upon submicron scale measurements within individual phases of defects, but rather exploits mesoscale measurements of collective response, making use of modern data science to assess uncertainties of both model form and model parameters. The first step of the three-step framework requires the establishment of a low-cost Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate (reduced order) model that predicts the indentation yield strength estimated by computationally expensive crystal plasticity finite element simulations. To reduce the number of finite element simulations neces­ sary to establish the surrogate model, this work adopts an information-driven approach that se­ lects additional simulations based on their potential to improve model accuracy. The second step involves the application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques in order to estimate the feasible intrinsic parameter configurations that are capable of capturing the trends in the experimental data. The sampling process provides rigorous uncertainty estimates for the intrinsic properties, in addition to providing an approximation for the model evidence. The model evidence is used to compute the relative probabilities of the chosen physics-based crystal plas­ ticity model forms in the third step of the framework to enable model fusion. This framework is delineated and demonstrated in this paper through a case study involving two currently used crystal plasticity models for the colony morphology of Ti-6Al-4V.},

              Titanium alloys. The main steps involved in the proposed framework include: (i) rigorous statistical evaluation of the salient morphological characteristics of the lamellar grains using image processing techniques, (ii) modeling the effects of dislocation slip transfer as additive penalties to the critical resolved shear strengths of the different slip systems in each phase, (iii) consideration of multiple geometric slip transfer criteria for the numerical evaluation of the different penalty terms, and (iv) the Bayesian calibration of the material parameters in the constitutive descriptions using spherical nanoindentation experimental data on a polycrystalline Ti-6Al-4V sample. Step (iv) described above involves the construction and refinement of a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate model for the indentation measurements, which is trained on crystal plasticity finite element simulations incorporating the constitutive descriptions selected in Steps (ii) and (iii). The GP surrogates are then combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques to calibrate the parameters in the various constitutive models studied in this work. Additionally, we have computed the posterior model probabilities for all the constitutive models considered and identified the most plausible slip transfer criterion. This specific constitutive model is then utilized to present a homogenized crystal plasticity model for the lamellar morphology. The proposed framework presents a robust scale-bridging protocol for incorporating the uncertain information obtained from lower scales.},

For current production-ready SiC SiC, this temperature capability for long time structural applications is ∼1250°C, which is better than ∼1100°C for the best metallic superalloys. Foreseeing that even higher structural reliability and temperature capability would continue to increase the advantages of SiC SiC composites, progress in recent years has also been made at NASA toward improving the properties of SiC SiC composites by optimizing the various constituent materials and geometries within composite microstructures. The primary objective of this chapter is to detail this latter progress, both fundamentally and practically, with particular emphasis on recent advancements in materials and processes for the fiber, fiber coating, fiber architecture, and matrix, and in the design methods for incorporating these constituents into SiC SiC microstructures with improved thermo-structural performance.},

	abstract = {We propose here a model to describe the rupture of woven ply laminated structures. The validity scope of this model depends on the ‘diffused damage’ phase up to the first intra-laminar macro-crack only (first ply failure model). The model is based on a previous continuum damage approach [Hochard C, Aubourg PA, Charles JP. Modelling of the mechanical behaviour of woven fabric CFRP laminates up to failure. Compos Sci Technol 2001;61:221–30] and a new non-local fibre rupture criterion. This non-local criterion uses a ply scale characteristic volume of ply thickness and in plane area depending on the meso-structure of the ply. In the case of the balanced woven ply studied here, a simple circular area is chosen and identified on a test showing a stress gradient. The local shear damage and inelastic strain evolution laws and the non-local fibre rupture criterion have been integrated in Abaqus. Numerical results compared to tests for woven ply laminated structures show the efficiency of the proposed approach.},

This non-local criterion was based on the mean values determined over a Fracture Characteristic Volume (FCV) corresponding to a cylinder with a circular area and the same thickness as the ply. This non-local approach along with a ply scale continuum damage behavioural model was implemented in the ABAQUS Finite Element Code. The behavioural model was developed from a classical Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) model [Ladevèze P. A damage computational method for composite structures. Comput Struct 1992;44:79–87]. In the present study, this approach was extended to the case of unbalanced woven ply. The FCV approach and the CDM behavioural model are presented and comparisons are made between the experimental data and the modelling predictions obtained on plates with open holes, notches and saw cuts.},

For these tests, the onset of nonlinearity and subsequent plasticity due to matrix microcracking and interfacial debonding and sliding are satisfactorily represented by a linear Drucker–Prager model for failure initiation in the effective medium along with a fully-associated flow rule with isotropic, perfectly-plastic flow. Composite failure is assumed to be correlated with the maximum local stress averaged over a gauge volume dictated by the fiber tow width.

The reinforcement geometry is characterized by Micro CT in terms of fiber tow centroid coordinates and cross-sectional dimensions. A comprehensive slicing and data correction method, which transforms the intact 3D geometry into a four-dimensional dataset, is established for all tow genera. A quantitative understanding of the variability of reinforcement architecture is presented via various statistical descriptors. In order to preserve the mainly statistical characteristics of tow feature parameters, D-vine copula functions are adopted to address their irregular marginal distributions and joint dependence. The reconstructed data is verified by the marginal probability density functions, the bivariate distributions and the correlation matrices of feature parameters. An inverse design from data to textile geometry is achieved by dedicated codes in TexGen. The whole framework is driven by acquired data automatically and can generate any number of statistically equivalent RVEs for further simulations.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty quantification is critical for the full exploitation of composite materials’ potential. Inverse methods offer the possibility of indirectly characterizing the uncertainty of microscopic parameters by employing data sets from standard structural tests in higher scales. Two crucial requirements though, are the efficient modeling especially for the nonlinear prediction, and the measurement error availability from the tests which affects the updated scatter. This study employs effective stiffness and strength experimental data in order to quantify uncertainties of a carbon fiber UD composite in the microscale. A polynomial chaos surrogate model is trained from finite element simulations, able to efficiently predict the homogenized stiffness and strength for the uncertainty quantification procedure. The random parameters which are influential enough to be updated, are identified via a variance-based global sensitivity analysis. The inverse problem is solved with the Bayesian inference method, which updates any prior estimation of the probability models of the input parameters, based on output observations from the tests. Results show significant uncertainty reduction in comparison with typically used variance values in the literature and can be used to enrich the composite material databases. The proposed methodology is applied for the transverse tensile load case, although its non-intrusive nature allows applications for more load cases and various setups.},

	abstract = {Woven fiber composites have been increasingly employed as light-weight materials in aerospace, construction, and transportation industries due to their superior properties. These materials possess a hierarchical structure that necessitates the use of multiscale simulations in their modeling. To account for the inherent uncertainty in materials, such simulations must be integrated with statistical uncertainty quantification (UQ) and propagation (UP) methods. However, limited advancement has been made in this regard due to the significant computational costs and complexities in modeling spatially correlated structural variations coupled at different scales. In this work, a non-intrusive approach is proposed for multiscale UQ and UP to address these limitations. We introduce the top-down sampling method that allows to model non-stationary and continuous (but not differentiable) spatial variations of uncertainty sources by creating nested random fields (RFs) where the hyperparameters of an ensemble of RFs is characterized by yet another RF. We employ multi-response Gaussian RFs in top-down sampling and leverage statistical techniques (such as metamodeling and dimensionality reduction) to address the considerable computational costs of multiscale simulations. We apply our approach to quantify the uncertainty in a cured woven composite due to spatial variations of yarn angle, fiber volume fraction, and fiber misalignment angle. Our results indicate that, even in linear analysis, the effect of uncertainty sources on the material’s response could be significant.},

The sensitivity of four meso-scale uncertain input parameters on the macro-scale response are investigated; i.e. the yarn height, the yarn spacing, the yarn width and the friction coefficient. The Pearson coefficients are adopted to measure the effect of each uncertain input variable on the structural response. Due to computational effectiveness, the sensitivity analysis is based on response surface models. The Sobol’s variance-based method which consists of first-order and total-effect sensitivity indices are presented. The sensitivity analysis utilizes linear and quadratic correlation matrices, its corresponding correlation coefficients and the coefficients of determination of the response uncertainty criteria. The correlation analysis, the response surface model and Sobol’s indices are presented and compared by means of uncertainty criteria influences on MataBerkait-dry woven fabric material properties. To anticipate, it is observed that the friction coefficient and yarn height are the most influential factors with respect to the specified macro-scale mechanical responses.},

A RVE can be associated with different physical and statistical properties of microstructures. The methodology is applied to specific two–phase microstructure–based random sets. Statistical parameters are introduced to study the variation in the RVE size versus volume fractions of components and the contrast in their properties. The key notion of the integral range is introduced to determine these variations. For a given desired precision, we can provide a minimal volume size for the computation of effective mechanical and thermal properties. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate that a volume exists which is statistically representative of random microstructures.

	abstract = {The distributions of the extreme-value driving force(s) for surface vs. subsurface fatigue crack formation (nucleation and early growth) in high-cycle fatigue are evaluated for a microstructure variant of duplex Ti–6Al–4V. In polycrystalline metals, previous work has explored estimation of the driving force(s) for fatigue crack formation at the scale of the grains by computing non-local fatigue indicator parameters (FIPs) based on the cyclic plastic strain averaged over domains on the length scale of the grains. Instantiated statistical volume elements (SVEs), which sample the distributed microstructure attributes of interest for a given material system, can be simulated via the finite element method with embedded polycrystalline plasticity models to estimate the distributed plasticity and resulting FIPs. This strategy of simulating multiple SVEs is in contrast to the simulation of a single representative volume element which is typically untenably large for extreme-value distributions of microstructure attributes or response variables. In this work, multiple SVEs are instantiated with both traction-free (i.e. surface) boundary conditions and fully periodic (i.e. subsurface) boundary conditions. In addition to estimating the extreme-value distributions of the FIPs, newly introduced extreme-value marked correlation functions are applied to characterize the coupled crystallographic microstructure attributes (e.g. grain size, grain orientation, grain misorientation) that most influence the extreme-value distributions of the FIPs. It is shown that there is overlap in the distributions of the driving forces for surface vs. subsurface crack formation in the low to moderate range of failure probability based on FIPs; however, at higher failure probability levels, the driving forces are highest for surface crack formation. The overlap in the distributions of the driving forces for fatigue crack formation in the low to moderate probability range may assist in describing the competing surface vs. subsurface failure modes that are observed experimentally.},

	abstract = {Mechanics of Structure Genome (MSG) is extended to provide a new two-step homogenization approach to predict the viscoelastic behaviors of textile composites. The first homogenization step (micro-homogenization) deals with determining the viscoelastic properties of yarns from fibers (assumed to be linear elastic) and matrix (assumed to be linear viscoelastic) using the MSG solid model. In the second homogenization step (macro-homogenization), the viscoelastic behaviors of textile composites are computed from the homogenized yarns and matrix properties using the MSG plate model. Representative volume element (RVE) analysis using a commercial finite element package at micro-scale is conducted to verify the accuracy of MSG micro-homogenization. The viscoelastic behaviors of textile composites at macro-scale using the MSG plate model are validated using experimental data. All the results are in good agreements. The proposed approach is applied to several commonly used woven composites to study the effects of different weave patterns on the viscoelastic behaviors.},

The developed scheme features a Bayesian optimal experimental design process that operates in a closed loop. During each iteration of the process, a Gaussian process regression model is constructed based on the available computational data and used to emulate the response of the material in the unexplored regions of the materials design space. The sequential exploration of the materials design space is carried out by using an optimal experiment selection policy based on the expected hyper-volume improvement acquisition function that accounts for the uncertainty on the predictions of the regression model.

In this work, we seek to learn a distribution of microstructure parameters that are consistent in the sense that the forward propagation of this distribution through a crystal plasticity finite element model (CPFEM) matches a target distribution on materials properties. This stochastic inversion formulation infers a distribution of acceptable/consistent microstructures, as opposed to a deterministic solution, which expands the range of feasible designs in a probabilistic manner. To solve this stochastic inverse problem, we employ a recently developed uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework based on push-forward probability measures, which combines techniques from measure theory and Bayes rule to define a unique and numerically stable solution. This approach requires making an initial prediction using an initial guess for the distribution on model inputs and solving a stochastic forward problem. To reduce the computational burden in solving both stochastic forward and stochastic inverse problems, we combine this approach with a machine learning (ML) Bayesian regression model based on Gaussian processes and demonstrate the proposed methodology on two representative case studies in structure-property linkages.},

The homogenization theory, allowing extracting the behavior of periodic materials built from the repetition of a representative volume element (RVE), is applied to impose macroscopic strain fields and periodic boundary conditions to the RVE. Classical numerical homogenization techniques are adapted to the selected XFEM-level set framework. Following previous works by the authors on analytical sensitivity analysis (Noël et al.

The emergence of novel additive manufacturing techniques fosters research towards new approaches to tailor materials properties. This paper derives a formulation to prevent the occurrence of high stress concentrations, often present in optimized microstructures. Applying macroscopic test strain fields to the material, microstructural layouts, reducing the stress level while exhibiting the best overall stiffness properties, are sought for. Equivalent stiffness properties of the designed material are predicted by numerical homogenization and considering a metallic base material for the microstructure, it is assumed that the classical Von Mises stress criterion remains valid to predict the material elastic allowable stress at the microscale. Stress constraints with arbitrary bounds are considered, assuming that a sizing optimization step could be applied to match the actual stress limits under realistic service loads. Density–based topology optimization, relying on the SIMP model, is used and the qp–approach is exploited to overcome the singularity phenomenon arising from the introduction of stress constraints with vanishing material. Optimization problems are solved using mathematical programming schemes, in particular MMA, so that a sensitivity analysis of stress responses at the microstructural level is required and performed considering the adjoint approach. Finally, the developed method is first validated with classical academic benchmarks and then illustrated with an original application: tailoring metamaterials for a museum anti–seismic stand.},

Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a measurement of one of these quantities, but not both. This has led to a growing need to forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting the detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present an unbiased forecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass–radius relation conditioned on a sample of 316 well-constrained objects. Our publicly available code, Forecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties, and the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By conditioning our model on a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars, Forecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for objects covering nine orders of magnitude in mass. Classiﬁcation is naturally performed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds, Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds, and stars. Our classiﬁcation identiﬁes dwarf planets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth) and brown dwarfs as merely high-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass–radius relation at 2.0-+00..67 M⊕, which we associate with the divide between solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis adds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky superEarths represent a narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively, then, the Earth is the super-Earth we have been looking for.},

To this end, we introduce a novel alternating neural architecture, allowing for the incorporation of highly customized priors from data in a principled manner. We also show how the recent success of Regularization by Denoising (RED) can, at least to some extent, be explained as an approximation of the PM. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the idea can be applied to stop the degradation of Deep Image Prior (DIP) reconstructions over time.},

	abstract = {The ability to automatically discover patterns and perform extrapolation is an essential quality of intelligent systems. Kernel methods, such as Gaussian processes, have great potential for pattern extrapolation, since the kernel flexibly and interpretably controls the generalisation properties of these methods. However, automatically extrapolating large scale multidimensional patterns is in general difficult, and developing Gaussian process models for this purpose involves several challenges. A vast majority of kernels, and kernel learning methods, currently only succeed in smoothing and interpolation. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that Gaussian processes are typically only tractable for small datasets, and scaling an expressive kernel learning approach poses different challenges than scaling a standard Gaussian process model. One faces additional computational constraints, and the need to retain significant model structure for expressing the rich information available in a large dataset. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process approach for large scale multidimensional pattern extrapolation. We recover sophisticated out of class kernels, perform texture extrapolation, inpainting, and video extrapolation, and long range forecasting of land surface temperatures, all on large multidimensional datasets, including a problem with 383,400 training points. The proposed method significantly outperforms alternative scalable and flexible Gaussian process methods, in speed and accuracy. Moreover, we show that a distinct combination of expressive kernels, a fully non-parametric representation, and scalable inference which exploits existing model structure, are critical for large scale multidimensional pattern extrapolation.},

	abstract = {The local field potential (LFP) is a source of information about the broad patterns of brain activity, and the frequencies present in these time-series measurements are often highly correlated between regions. It is believed that these regions may jointly constitute a "brain state," relating to cognition and behavior. An infinite hidden Markov model (iHMM) is proposed to model the evolution of brain states, based on electrophysiological LFP data measured at multiple brain regions. A brain state influences the spectral content of each region in the measured LFP. A new state-dependent tensor factorization is employed across brain regions, and the spectral properties of the LFPs are characterized in terms of Gaussian processes (GPs). The LFPs are modeled as a mixture of GPs, with state- and region-dependent mixture weights, and with the spectral content of the data encoded in GP spectral mixture covariance kernels. The model is able to estimate the number of brain states and the number of mixture components in the mixture of GPs. A new variational Bayesian split-merge algorithm is employed for inference. The model infers state changes as a function of external covariates in two novel electrophysiological datasets, using LFP data recorded simultaneously from multiple brain regions in mice; the results are validated and interpreted by subject-matter experts.},

We introduce simple closed form kernels that can be used with Gaussian processes to discover patterns and enable extrapolation. These kernels are derived by modelling a spectral density -- the Fourier transform of a kernel -- with a Gaussian mixture. The proposed kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian process inference remains simple and analytic. We demonstrate the proposed kernels by discovering patterns and performing long range extrapolation on synthetic examples, as well as atmospheric CO2 trends and airline passenger data. We also show that we can reconstruct standard covariances within our framework.},

Despite their computational efficiency, flow-based models generally have much worse density modeling performance compared to state-of-the-art autoregressive models. In this paper, we investigate and improve upon three limiting design choices employed by flow-based models in prior work: the use of uniform noise for dequantization, the use of inexpressive affine flows, and the use of purely convolutional conditioning networks in coupling layers. Based on our findings, we propose Flow++, a new flow-based model that is now the state-of-the-art non-autoregressive model for unconditional density estimation on standard image benchmarks.

In this paper we propose Glow, a simple type of generative flow using invertible 1x1 convolution. Using our method we demonstrate a significant improvement in log-likelihood and qualitative sample quality.

	abstract = {We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional densities called Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the Jacobian determinant and inverse transform is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable. Unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting.},

	abstract = {The thickness of the hot component in a turbine engine is usually small. Therefore, the traditional prediction model of anisotropic thermal conductivity (ATC) based on the periodic hypothesis may be improper for use in the thermal analysis of ceramic matrix composite (CMC) components with a thin-wall structure. Thus, the prediction model for the ATC of a 2.5-D braided CMC was investigated, taking into account the actual thickness of the CMC thin-wall structure. An RVE (Representative Volume Element) model with a periodic boundary and a full-size model with the actual thickness were built to study the temperature ﬁeld, the heat ﬂux ﬁeld, and the effective thermal conductivity of the CMC. A validation experiment was carried out to verify the accuracy of the two prediction models. The effect of the composite’s thickness on the ATC and the critical thickness suitable for the RVE model were also studied. The results showed that in the thermal analysis of the thin-wall structure, the RVE model had a large deviation in the estimation of the effective thermal conductivity in the thickness direction. The relative error between the numerical data based on the RVE model and the experimental data reached 10.93\%, while the relative error was only 3.53\% for the full-size model. Additionally, with increasing thickness, the effective thermal conductivities, based on the RVE model and the full-size model, were close to each other. For the critical thickness for the RVE model, which would be suitable for the prediction of the ATC, if the material’s thermal properties such as the absolute value ratio and the level of anisotropy changed, the corresponding critical thickness was also different. For the ATC of the SiC/SiC composites used in this study, the critical thickness was found to be 18.4 mm, nearly 31 times larger than the RVE model’s thickness.},

Constitutive equations based on crystal plasticity have been implemented in FE simulations, and these slip–based calculations have the potential to model a variety of interesting phenomena. However, the substructure of the deformed state in metals is inherently discontinuous. To what extent continuum plasticity calculations can be reasonably used for deformation microstructure predictions depends on the microstructural interpretation of the constitutive models. It is possible with quite simple models to predict orientation gradients at large second–phase particles and at grain boundaries. Because of the implicit link between the substructure and mechanical behaviour of metals, and the great flexibility that crystal plasticity models have, the prediction of at least some of the more important aspects of substructure, by association with state variables, is possible.},

Degradation is characterized through mechanical tests under cyclic and quasi-static tensile loading in the near-threshold regime, at stresses at or slightly above the matrix cracking limit. These tests are augmented by examinations of fracture surfaces and polished cross-sections, measurements of fracture mirror radii, and measurements of interfacial debond toughness and sliding resistance. Degradation involves highly localized consumption of fibers through reactions of water vapor with the fibers and the BN coatings in regions adjacent to the few matrix cracks present at low stresses; the global hysteresis response and the average interfacial properties are minimally affected. Boria formed by oxidation of BN appears to play a fluxing role; it combines with silica on the fibers to form a non-protective molten glass. Inhomogeneous fiber consumption leads to stress concentrations in the fibers and hence reduced fiber strength. Spatial variations in the degradation process occur at two length scales: at the macroscopic scale, because of cracking of the external CVI SiC overcoat and subsequent water ingress through the cracks, and at the tow-scale, because of cracking of the CVI SiC around the tows. Parsing the kinetic processes over the two length scales remains a significant challenge.},

Specifically, "close-packed", i.e., fibers surrounded by six nearest neighbor fibers (called "hexagonal" hereafter) versus "isolated" fibers, defined as fibers at least one fiber diameter distant from the next nearest fiber, were compared. In spite of the more compliant behavior of isolated fibers under quasi-static and cyclic indentation loads, initiation of fiber-matrix debonding and push-in failure (fiber splitting into two or three parts) occurred at roughly comparable loads for both, "hexagonal" and "isolated" fibers. Earlier tests on thinner slices of such composites (thickness around 30 μm) had resulted in full debonding and fiber push-out without fiber failure. The fibers in the thicker slices showed first indenter imprints on the surface and an increasing hysteretic behavior in the load-displacement curves before debonding. The analysis of the cyclic load-displacement curves yields the elastic-plastic and the hysteretic (debonding) energy contributions.},

Our approach is based on the calculation of an “effective viscosity” which is then used as a reference viscosity for any underlying viscoelastic (or even visco-elasto-plastic) model. Here we use a Maxwell-model which best describes stress relaxation and is therefore likely most important for the formation of large meteorite impact basins. While common viscoelastic behavior during mantle convection or other slow geodynamic or geological processes is mostly controlled by diffusion and dislocation creep, we show that the Peierls mechanism dominates at the large strain rates that typically occur during meteorite impacts. Thus, the resulting visco-elasto-plastic rheology allows implementation of a more realistic mantle behavior in computer simulations, especially for those dealing with large meteorite impacts. The approach shown here opens the way to more faithful simulations of large impact basin formation, especially in elucidating the physics behind the formation of the external fault rings characteristic of large lunar basins.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional visco-elastic-plastic constitutive model of isotropic magneto-sensitive (MS) rubber with amplitude, frequency and magnetic dependency under a continuum constitutive framework is developed. MS rubber is a kind of smart material mainly composed of a rubber matrix and magnetizable particles. Under a magnetic field, there is an increase of its dynamic modulus due to the interaction between the magnetic field and MS rubber, which is often referred to as the magnetic dependency of MS rubber. Experimental results reveal that besides the magnetic dependency, there is a frequency and amplitude dependency of its dynamic modulus. In specific, the modulus of MS rubber increases with increasing frequency and dereases with increasing strain amplitude. To depict the above properties and to consider the balance of energy in continuum mechanics framework, a new constitutive model consisting of a viscoelastic fractional derivative element, a bounding surface model in series with a neo-Hookean elastic model with magnetic sensitivity and a magnetic stress tensor term for MS rubber is proposed. The contribution of this constitutive model is that by using a free energy based method, with only eight material parameters, the amplitude, frequency and magnetic dependency of MS rubber can be reflected. After parameter identification, the simulation results show a good agreement with those of measurements. Therefore, by utilizing the model proposed, the ability of approaching the dynamic behavior of MS rubber-based vibration reduction devices in the design phase is possible which contributes to the application of MS rubber in noise and vibration reduction area.},

The neighboring chains on the basis of cooperative motions, change their positions, and the time-dependent response is determined by the distribution of meso‑regions with varying energy barriers. In the present work, the Gaussian distribution was selected to be followed by the activation energies. The constitutive equation was solved for dynamic mechanical, stress-relaxation and creep experiments. It has been shown that starting from one viscoelastic function in the frequency (time) domain, all viscoelastic functions in the time (frequency) domain could hereafter be evaluated, with the same parameter values.

On one side, it’s shown that, in comparison with the classical homogenisation approaches, the considered upscaling method: (i) requires no RVE (representative volume element), (ii) can be applied when the statistical homogeneity of the material ceases to exist and (iii) when sharp localisations are present. On the other, (iv) the quasi-brittle behaviour of the material is justified without any assumption on the model at the mesoscopic scale. Most prominently this paper shows that (v) the consideration of an effective homogeneous continuum to substitute a microscopically heterogeneous one is dictated by the use of a much larger regularisation parameter than what has been classically established.},

	abstract = {The calibration of continuum damage mechanics (CDM) models is often performed by least-squares regression through the design of specifically crafted experiments to identify a deterministic solution of model parameters minimizing the squared error between the model prediction and the corresponding experimental result. Spe­ cifically, this work demonstrates a successful application of Bayesian inference for the simultaneous estimation of eleven material parameters of a viscous multimode CDM model conditioned upon a small inhomogeneous multiaxial experimental dataset. The stochastic treatment of CDM model parameters provides uncertainty esti­ mates, enables the propagation of uncertainty into further analyses, and provides for principled decision making regarding informative subsequent experimental tests of value. The methodology presented in this work is also broadly applicable to various mechanical models with high-dimensional parameter sets.},

It is demonstrated that the underlying spectral framework of the MSD methodology facilitates an efficient consideration of the complete set of crystallographic textures in the design optimization. In order to accomplish this task a number of important enhancements had to be introduced to the MSD framework. The most significant enhancement is in the mathematical description of the design space, i.e. the texture hull. The advantages of the new approach described in this paper are illustrated with two specific design case studies involving different assumptions of symmetry at the sample scale. In both case studies presented, it is seen that the overall performance is strongly influenced by the crystallographic texture in the sample. Furthermore, the relevant property closures and performance maps accounting for the complete set of textures are also depicted.},

This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas.

In this work, we develop a new CNN architecture that utilizes a drastically reduced number of trainable parameters for building these linkages, compared to the benchmarks in current literature. This is accomplished by creating CNN architectures that completely avoid the use of fully connected layers, while using the 2point spatial correlations of the microstructure as the input to the CNN. In addition to increased robustness (because of the much smaller number of trainable parameters), the CNN models developed in this work facilitate the construction of property closures at very low computational cost. This is because it allows for easy exploration of the space of valid 2-point spatial correlations, which is known to be a convex hull. Consequently, one can generate new sets of valid 2-point spatial correlations from previously available valid sets of 2-point spatial correlations, simply as convex combinations. This work demonstrates the signiﬁcant beneﬁts of utilizing 2-point spatial correlations as the input to the CNN, in place of the voxelated discrete microstructures used in current benchmarks.},

Microstructure-sensitive design (MSD) aims at providing inverse design methodologies that facilitate design of material internal structure for performance optimization. Spectral methods are applied across the structure, property and processing design spaces in order to compress the computational requirements for linkages between the spaces and enable inverse design. Research has focused mainly on anisotropic, polycrystalline materials, where control of local crystal orientation can result in a broad range of property combinations. This review presents the MSD framework in the context of both the engineering advances that have led to its creation, and those that complement or provide alternative methods for design of materials (meaning ‘optimization of material structure’ in this context). A variety of definitions for the structure of materials are presented, with an emphasis on correlation functions; and spectral methods are introduced for compact descriptions and efficient computations. The microstructure hull is defined as the design space for structure in the spectral framework. Reconstruction methods provide invertible links between statistical descriptions of structure, and deterministic instantiations. Subsequently, structure–property relations are reviewed, and again subjected to representation via spectral methods. The concept of a property closure is introduced as the design space for performance optimization, and methods for moving between the closures and hulls are presented as the basis for the subsequent discussion on microstructure design. Finally, the spectral framework is applied to deformation processes, and methodologies that facilitate process design are reviewed.},

	abstract = {Homogenization relations, linking a material's properties at the mesoscale to those at the macroscale, are fundamental tools for design and analysis of microstructure. Recent advances in this field have successfully applied spectral techniques to Kroner-type perturbation expansions for polycrystalline and composite materials to provide efficient inverse relations for materials design. These expansions have been termed ‘weak-contrast’ expansions due to the conditionally convergent integrals, and the reliance upon only small perturbations from the reference property. In 1955, Brown suggested a different expansion for electrical conductivity that resulted in absolutely convergent integrals. Torquato subsequently applied the method to elasticity, with good results even for high-contrast materials; thus it is commonly referred to as a ‘strong contrast’ expansion. The methodology has been applied to elasticity for two phases of isotropic material, generally assuming macroscopic isotropy (with noted exceptions), thus resulting in a rather elegant form of the solution. More recently, a multi-phase form of the solution was developed for conductivity. This paper builds upon this result to apply the method to elasticity of polycrystalline materials with both local and global anisotropy. New spectral formulations are subsequently developed for both the weak and strong contrast solutions. These form the basis for efficient microstructure analysis using these frameworks, and subsequently for inverse design applications. The process is taken through to demonstration of a property closure, which acts as the basis for materials design; the closure delineates the envelope of all physically realizable property combinations for the chosen properties, based on the particular homogenization relation being used.},

The aim of IEE is to train engineering students to bring together expertise from different disciplines in a single context. This review synthesizes IEE research with a focus on characterizing vision, teaching practices, and support. Purpose We aim to show how IEE is conceptualized, implemented, and facilitated in higher engineering education at the levels of curricula and courses. This aim leads to two research questions: What aspects of vision, teaching, and support have emerged as topics of interest in empirical studies of IEE? What points of attention regarding vision, teaching, and support can be identified in empirical studies of IEE as supporting or challenging IEE? Scope/Method Ninety-nine studies published between 2005 and 2016 were included in a qualitative analysis across studies. The procedure included formulation of research questions, searching and screening of studies according to inclusion/exclusion criteria, description of study characteristics, appraisal, and synthesis of results. Conclusions Challenges exist for identifying clear learning goals and assessments for interdisciplinary education in engineering (vision). Most pedagogy for interdisciplinary learning is designed to promote collaborative teamwork requiring organization and team management. Our review suggests that developing interdisciplinary skills, knowledge, and values needs sound pedagogy and teaming experiences that provide students with authentic ways of engaging in interdisciplinary practice (teaching). Furthermore, there is a limited understanding of what resources hinder the development of engineering programs designed to support interdisciplinarity (support).},

Such variability can be present in the form of both morphological and constituent property variability. To understand the effect of this variability on macroscopic mechanical behavior, many statistically equivalent microstructures must be evaluated. This requires the ability to generate such microstructures. In this work, morphological variability was quantified by image analysis of actual microstructures. To reproduce this variability, a methodology was developed in which random microstructures are generated and subsequently adjusted to simultaneously match both short- and long-range statistics of actual microstructures. Synthetic microstructures were generated at a length scale of 70?µm, corresponding to the length scale at which fiber volume fractions of adjacent microstructures are uncorrelated. The utility of this methodology was also demonstrated for larger microstructures containing defects such as alignment fibers, voids and resin seams.},

	abstract = {Micromechanical models aimed at simulating deformation textures and resulting plastic anisotropy need to incorporate local plastic strain heterogeneities arising from grain interactions for better predictions. The ALAMEL model [Van Houtte, P., Li, S., Seefeldt, M., Delannay, L. 2005. Deformation texture prediction: from the Taylor model to the advanced Lamel model. Int. J. Plasticity 21, 589–624], is one of the models in which the heterogeneous nature of plastic deformation in metals is introduced by accounting for the influence of a grain boundary on the cooperative deformation of adjacent grains. This is achieved by assuming that neighbouring grains undergo heterogeneous shear rates parallel to the grain boundary. The present article focuses on understanding the plastic deformation fields near the grain boundaries and the influence of grain interaction on intra-grain deformations. Crystal Plasticity Finite Element Method (CPFEM) is employed on a periodic unit cell consisting of four grains discretised into a large number of elements. A refined study of the local variation of strain rates, both along and perpendicular to the grain boundaries permits an assessment of the assumptions made in the ALAMEL model. It is shown that the ALAMEL model imbibes the nature of plastic deformation at the grain boundaries very well. However, near triple junctions, the influence of a third grain induces severe oscillations of the stress tensor, reflecting a singularity. According to CPFEM, such singularity can lead to grain subdivision by the formation of new boundaries originating at the triple junction.},

	abstract = {Shot-peening-induced compressive residual stresses are often introduced in Ni-base superalloy components to help prevent or retard surface fatigue crack initiation and early growth at near surface inclusions. In certain cases these compressive residual stresses can shift the fatigue crack initiation site from surface to sub-surface locations. However, the ability to computationally predict the improvement in fatigue life response and scatter due to induced compressive residual stresses are lightly treated in the literature. To address this issue, a method to incorporate shot-peened residual stresses within a 3D polycrystalline microstructure is introduced in this work. These residual stresses are induced by a distribution of fictitious or quasi-thermal expansion eigenstrain as a function of depth from the specimen surface. Two different material models are used, a J2 plasticity and a crystal plasticity model. First, the J2 plasticity model with combined isotropic and kinematic hardening is used to determine the distribution of quasi-thermal expansion eigenstrain as a function of depth from the surface necessary to induce the target residual stress profile within the microstructure. This distribution of quasi-thermal expansion eigenstrain is then used within a crystal plasticity framework to model the effect of microstructure heterogeneity on the variability in residual stresses among multiple instantiations. This model is verified with experimental X-ray diffraction (XRD) data for scatter in residual stresses for both the initial microstructure and after a single load/unload cycle.},

Four large-grained tantalum tensile specimens were strained in uniaxial tension, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data were collected, and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) maps of the four specimens in the unloaded state were produced. EBSD-based GND maps revealed several types of features with high GND content which caused back stress in the specimens. Correlations between five geometrically-based grain boundary (GB) transmission factors and the GB GND content were evaluated, and statistically significant correlations were found for transmission factors based on Livingston and Chalmer's N factor, Werner and Prantl's slip transfer number, and GB misorientation. The sign of individual components of the Nye tensor were used to visually and quantitatively identify clustering of GNDs of the same sign, thus giving additional evidence of increasing back stress due to deformation. Deformation of one of the specimens was simulated using multiple CPFEM based modeling approaches and predicted stress-strain responses are compared. The super dislocation model (SD model) — a crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) which incorporates elastic dislocation interactions — was able to isolate impact of back stress on the overall flow stress. The SD model predicted correct stresses when compared with experimental data; however, when the elastic interactions in the SD model were turned off, stress predictions were 25\% too low. Thus, demonstrating the importance of incorporating back stress into the model.},

It is emphasized that materials design is not equivalent to modeling across scales of material structure hierarchy; the latter provides support for decisions made in design and development of materials in the presence of uncertainty. We next provide compelling reasons to develop microstructure-sensitive multiscale models to facilitate simulation-assisted alloy design. Hierarchical and concurrent multiscale models are defined and contrasted in terms of utility in supporting materials design.

Toward this end, we propose a multiscale prediction model to investigate the effective thermal conductivity of porous plain-woven carbonized silica/phenolic composites by combining finite element analysis with existing two-phase composite models. A general approach is presented to compute the effective thermal conductivity with varying structural parameters. First, to consider effect of pores in phenolic resin matrix, the porous model is established to calculate the effective thermal conductivity of matrix with different porosities and pore morphologies. Then, heat transfer simulations are conducted on the multiscale model, including the yarn scale in the axial and transverse directions and the woven composite scale in the inplane and out-of-plane directions. Empirical formulas for effective thermal conductivity are obtained, which comprehensively considers the factors of matrix porosity, fiber volume fraction, and temperature.},

The CMC is made of aluminosilicate matrix reinforced by 3M NextelTM 610 alumina ﬁbers (AS/N610) that are woven into an eightharness satin weave (8HSW) preform. Uniaxial tensile tests were carried out on both un-notched and single-edge-notched tensile (SENT) specimens of two different lay-ups, ð0=90ÞS and ð45=0= À 45=0ÞS , using a hydraulically activated load frame. The digital image correlation (DIC) technique was utilized to map the deformation histories and identify the locations of strain concentration for both unnotched and SENT specimens. The experimental results were subsequently used to develop a laminalevel constitutive model for a single 8HSW ply that incorporates damage and fracture mechanics implemented through a ﬁnite element (FE) framework. A secant-modulus approach was employed to model the pre-peak nonlinear damage evolution, while the post-peak softening was modeled using the smeared crack approach (SCA). Utilizing the ply properties measured from the un-notched ð0=90ÞS and ð45=0= À 45=0ÞS tension tests, the proposed computational model is able to predict the failure strength and strain localization in the SENT specimens.

In spite of the impressive advances in high performance computations, phase-field simulations for most practical problems in materials design are resource intensive because of the need to incorporate multiple physical fields over large-scale three-dimensional domains. There is, therefore, a need to learn and capture the underlying materials knowledge embedded in the results produced by such expensive simulations, and facilitating an easy transferability to new problems of interest. This paper demonstrates the viability of extracting the salient process-structure linkages from phase-field simulations, while casting them in forms amenable for a rapid and efficient exploration of a relatively large process space.

	abstract = {Process-based forest models generally have many parameters, multiple outputs of interest and a small underlying empirical database. These characteristics hamper parameterization. Bayesian calibration offers a solution to the calibration problem because it applies to models of any type or size. It provides parameter estimates, with measures of uncertainty and correlation among the parameters. The procedure begins by quantifying the uncertainty about parameter values in the form of a prior probability distribution. Then data on the output variables are used to update the parameter distribution by means of Bayes' Theorem. This yields a posterior calibrated distribution for the parameters, which can be summarized in the form of a mean vector and variance matrix. The predictive uncertainty of the model can be quantified by running it with different parameter settings, sampled from the posterior distribution. In a further step, one may evaluate the posterior probability of the model itself (rather than that of the parameters) and compare that against the probability of other models, to aid in model selection or improvement.Bayesian calibration of process-based models cannot be performed analytically, so the posterior parameter distribution must be approximated in the form of a representative sample of parameter values. This can be achieved by means of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, which is suitable for process-based models because of its simplicity and because it does not require advance knowledge of the shape of the posterior distribution.Despite the suitability of Bayesian calibration, the technique has rarely been used in forestry research. We introduce the method, using the example of a typical forest model. Further, we show that reductions in parameter uncertainty, and thus in output uncertainty, can be effected by increasing the variety of data, increasing the accuracy of measurements and increasing the length of time series.},

While there has been signiﬁcant developmental work on manufacturing the fuel particles, detailed understanding of the eﬀects of the complex in-service stress state combined with realistic materials property data under irradiation on fuel particle survival is not adequately understood. This particularly frustrates the modeling eﬀorts that seek to improve fuel performance through basic understanding. In this work a compilation of non-irradiated and irradiated properties of SiC are provided and reviewed and analyzed in terms of application to TRISO fuels. In addition to a compilation and review of literature data, new data generated to ﬁll holes in the existing database is included, speciﬁcally in the high-temperature irradiation regime. Another critical piece of information, the strength of the SiC/Pyrolytic carbon interface, was measured and is included, along with a formalism for its analysis. Finally, recommended empirical treatments of the data are suggested.},

	abstract = {A new experimental test rig has been used to measure the thermal diffusivity of a ﬁbre-reinforced ceramic matrix composite material (C/C–SiC) using laser pulse heating under conditions of both one-dimensional and three-dimensional heat transfer. To predict these measurements, a microstructural geometric unit cell model of the material has been developed from optical micrographs and which incorporates ﬁbre tows, matrix and interface materials. With the selection of a suitable ﬁnite-element mesh to model each material phase and the prescription of appropriate boundary conditions, this model has then been analysed for conditions of steady-state and transient heat conduction. In this way macrothermal properties have been calculated from the micro-thermal properties of each phase of the composite. The micro-thermal properties deduced from the analyses for these thermal conditions are in close mutual agreement, and within the bounds of numerical error. These results are presented in this paper alongside the experimental measurements. It is concluded that with careful geometric modelling and sensible property data selection, the microthermal properties obtained from the unit cell model can accurately predict the experimentally measured macro-thermal properties.},

In this study, a novel framework is described for extracting S-P linkages in polycrystalline microstructures that are obtained using 2-point spatial correlations (also called 2-point statistics) to quantify the material's microstructure, and principal component analysis (PCA) to represent this information in a reduced dimensional space. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the use of generalized spherical harmonics (GSH) as a Fourier basis for functions defined on the orientation space leads to a compact and computationally efficient representation of the desired S-P linkages. In this study, these novel protocols are developed and demonstrated for elastic stiffness and yield strength predictions for α− Ti microstructures using a dataset produced through microscale finite element simulations.},

	abstract = {Unit cells are established in this paper for micromechanical analyses of particle-reinforced composites. A range of typical packing systems are examined in a systematic manner for each of them. Only the translational symmetry transformations are employed in establishing these unit cells. There are a number of important advantages resulting from this. The unit cells so derived are capable of dealing with problems involving reinforcing particles of irregular geometries and local imperfections such as debonding between the particles and the matrix, and microcracks in the matrix, provided the regularity of the packing and the orientation of the particles and the imperfections is maintained within the material. Furthermore, all the unit cells established can be subjected to arbitrary combinations of macroscopic stresses or strains using a single set of boundary conditions unlike most available unit cells in the literature, with which individual macroscopic stress or strain components may have to be analysed using diﬀerent boundary conditions because of the use of reﬂectional symmetries. Boundary conditions for the unit cells proposed in this paper are derived from appropriate considerations of the conditions resulting from translational symmetry transformations. Applications of loads in terms of macroscopic stresses or strains and thermal loading to the unit cells are described in such a way that they can be implemented in a straightforward manner and the eﬀective properties of composites can be evaluated following a standard and simple procedure without a numerical averaging process. The implementation of the unit cells in the micromechanical ﬁnite element analysis of particle-reinforced composites has been demonstrated fully. Spherical particles are assumed and both the particle and the matrix are assumed to be linear elastic materials and the bonding between the particle and the matrix to be perfect. 3D brick elements have been employed to generate the meshes for analysing the unit cells corresponding to various packing systems. The eﬀective properties of the composite represented by the unit cells have been obtained through the analyses and they have been discussed and compared with results in the literature. Stress distributions in the particle and surrounding matrix have been examined. Some interesting characteristics of the diﬀerent packing systems have been elaborated.},

In damage evolution laws, the coupling effect among the damage modes and impediment effect of compression stress on the development of shear damage in different plane stress states are taken into account. Besides, the general plasticity theory is applied to describing the evolution of inelastic strain in tension and/or shear stress state. The Tsai–Wu failure criterion is adopted for strength analysis.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel approach for predicting the elastic fields in three-dimensional voxel-based microstructure datasets subjected to uniform periodic boundary conditions. This new formalism has its theoretical roots in the statistical continuum theories developed originally by Kroner. However, in the approach described by Kroner the terms in the series were established by selecting a reference medium and numerically evaluating a complex series of nested convolution integrals. This approach is largely hampered by the principal value problem and exhibits high sensitivity to the properties of the selected reference medium. In the present work, we have recast the same series expressions into much more computationally efficient representations using discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs). The main advantage of the new DFT-based framework is that it allows easy calibration of Kroner's expansions to results from finite element methods, thereby overcoming all of the main obstacles associated with the principal value problem and the need to select a reference medium. Consequently, the DFT-based approach presented here produces much more accurate predictions. In this paper the new mathematical formalism is first presented in a generalized framework, and its viability is then demonstrated for a selected class of two phase composites.

The experimental work consisted of room-temperature tensile tests on an 8-harness satin woven CMC material with three different notch geometries: (1) a through-thickness center hole, (2) a semi-circular notch on both edges, and (3) a rectangular slit on both edges. A multi-scale continuum damage mechanics model is used in conjunction with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to predict the overall failure response of the notched specimens. The continuum damage model is based on reduced order homogenization theory with damage variables defined at the meso-scale (i.e., at the scale of tows and matrix in the representative volume element of the CMC), and furthermore, the model considers failure in each of the constituents via softening stress-strain response with appropriate fracture energy-based rescaling to eliminate mesh-dependent behavior. The model parameters are derived from unnotched tension tests in [0/90] and [+/−45] orientations. It is shown that the model is able to successfully predict the overall stress-strain response as well as the ultimate strength of all three notch configurations. In addition, the model predicts the notch size effect (notch-sensitivity) in a manner consistent with existing data on CMCs.},

	abstract = {BN interphases in SiC/SiC minicomposites were produced by infiltration of fibre tows from BF3-NH3-H2 gaseous system. During interphase one-step processing, the tow travels through a reactor containing a succession of different hot areas. By TEM characterization, the BN interphases were found to be made of a structural gradient: from isotropic to highly anisotropic. The very first coating is poorly organised and allows protecting the fibre from a further chemical attack by the reactant mixture. The minicomposites were tensile tested at room temperature with unloading-reloading cycles. The BN interphases act as mechanical fuses; the fibre/matrix bonding intensity ranges from weak to rather strong depending on the tow travelling rate during interphase infiltration. The specimen lifetimes at 700°C under a constant tensile loading were measured in dry and moist air. Compared to a pyrocarbon reference interphase, the BN interphases significantly improve the oxidation resistance of the SiC/SiC minicomposites.},

	abstract = {Industrial power generation turbines operate at elevated temperatures for prolonged periods of time (around 100,000 h) which leads to significant microstructure evolution and mechanical property changes. Due to physical and structural constraints of operational turbines, only small scoop samples can be excised from heat-exposed steel components. Scoop samples at various service time intervals provide valuable information on microstructure changes, for example on graphite formation in carbon steels, with increasing service time. However, mechanical evaluation of such small material volumes poses significant challenges using conventional tests. A novel spherical microindentation technique is applied to evaluate a library of scoop samples ranging between 0 and 99,000 h of service. Furthermore, microstructure and yield strength data for the different exposure periods is used to construct a structure-property (S-P) linkage using the MKS homogenization approach that employs spatial correlations, principal component analysis, and regression techniques. The accuracy of the extracted S-P linkage was assessed on new samples that were not included in the calibration set.},

The machine learning approaches selected for the study have included different combinations of local/global and parametric/nonparametric approaches.

	abstract = {This paper presents a two-step Bayesian framework for the estimation of the intrinsic single crystal elastic stiffness parameters from the measurements of spherical indentation stress-strain responses in multiple individual grains of a polycrystalline sample, whose crystal lattice orientations have been measured using electron back-scattered diffraction technique. The first step requires the establishment of the functional dependence of the indentation elastic modulus given the lattice orientation and the intrinsic single crystal elastic stiffness parameters. Previous efforts for this step required a large database of computationally expensive finite element (FE) simulations in order to establish this function with adequate accuracy. In this paper, it is shown that the introduction of a Bayesian framework can greatly reduce the number of simulations necessary to establish this function, while introducing practically useful measures of uncertainty which can guide the selection of specific additional simulations that are expected to best improve the predictive accuracy of the function. The second step involves a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the distribution of possible values for the single crystal elastic stiffness parameters based on a given set of experimentally measured elastic indentation moduli in individual grains of different lattice orientations. This second step is accomplished by calibrating the available experimental data to the function established in the first step. This novel framework is presented and demonstrated in this paper for an as-cast cubic polycrystalline Fe-3\% Si sample and a hexagonal polycrystalline commercially pure (CP-Ti) titanium sample.},

The evolution laws of scalar damage variables derived from the components of the compliance tensor are established within a classical thermodynamic framework, using coupled multicriteria expressed in the space of the associated thermodynamic forces. Damage deactivation processes related to the unilateral crack closure effect observed under compressive loadings are introduced through the definition of effective compliance tensor components.

The stiffness of the UD composites made from these ﬁbres is 77GPa combined with the strain-to-failure between 15\% and 18\% depending on the level of adhesion. Silane treatments were used to modify the adhesion. By treating the stainless steel ﬁbres with different silane coupling agents, an increase of 50\% in the transverse 3-point-bending strength was realised. Increasing the adhesion by 50\% leads to a higher tensile strength and strain-to-failure in both UD and cross-ply laminates and a higher in-situ strength of the 90° plies. It also delays formation of matrix cracks and hinders growth of debonding.},

	abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible distributions over functions that enable high-level assumptions about unknown functions to be encoded in a parsimonious, flexible and general way. Although elegant, the application of GPs is limited by computational and analytical intractabilities that arise when data are sufficiently numerous or when employing non-Gaussian models. Consequently, a wealth of GP approximation schemes have been developed over the last 15 years to address these key limitations. Many of these schemes employ a small set of pseudo data points to summarise the actual data. In this paper, we develop a new pseudo-point approximation framework using Power Expectation Propagation (Power EP) that unifies a large number of these pseudo-point approximations. Unlike much of the previous venerable work in this area, the new framework is built on standard methods for approximate inference (variational free-energy, EP and Power EP methods) rather than employing approximations to the probabilistic generative model itself. In this way, all of approximation is performed at `inference time' rather than at `modelling time' resolving awkward philosophical and empirical questions that trouble previous approaches. Crucially, we demonstrate that the new framework includes new pseudo-point approximation methods that outperform current approaches on regression and classification tasks.},

Traditionally, kernel methods have been used in supervised learning problem with scalar outputs and indeed there has been a considerable amount of work devoted to designing and learning kernels. More recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs, motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning.

Development of reliable models which can predict such materials’ behavior is of massive advantage against the conventional experimental veriﬁcation which is hugely expensive and time-consuming. Three-dimensional ﬁnite element (FE) methods are used here for predicting Young’s modulus of two woven C/C composites where tensile tests are performed for validation. Stress distribution results indicate that a novel imagebased route for FE meshes compared to a unit cell approach gives stronger agreement with experimental data. The image-based approach captures true porosity as ﬁne microstructural details are converted from X-ray tomographic data.

	abstract = {In many tasks, in particular in natural science, the goal is to determine hidden system parameters from a set of measurements. Often, the forward process from parameter- to measurement-space is a well-defined function, whereas the inverse problem is ambiguous: one measurement may map to multiple different sets of parameters. In this setting, the posterior parameter distribution, conditioned on an input measurement, has to be determined. We argue that a particular class of neural networks is well suited for this task -- so-called Invertible Neural Networks (INNs). Although INNs are not new, they have, so far, received little attention in literature. While classical neural networks attempt to solve the ambiguous inverse problem directly, INNs are able to learn it jointly with the well-defined forward process, using additional latent output variables to capture the information otherwise lost. Given a specific measurement and sampled latent variables, the inverse pass of the INN provides a full distribution over parameter space. We verify experimentally, on artificial data and real-world problems from astrophysics and medicine, that INNs are a powerful analysis tool to find multi-modalities in parameter space, to uncover parameter correlations, and to identify unrecoverable parameters.},

Uncertainty in both the data and the code are important and must be mathematically understood to correctly perform both calibration and validation. Sensitivity analysis, being an important methodology in uncertainty analysis, is thus important to both calibration and validation. In this paper, we intend to clarify the language just used and express some opinions on the associated issues. We will endeavor to identify some technical challenges that must be resolved for successful validation of a predictive modeling capability. One of these challenges is a formal description of a “model discrepancy” term. Another challenge revolves around the general adaptation of abstract learning theory as a formalism that potentially encompasses both calibration and validation in the face of model uncertainty.},

              The ability to readily design novel materials with chosen functional properties on-demand represents a next frontier in materials discovery. However, thoroughly and efficiently sampling the entire design space in a computationally tractable manner remains a highly challenging task. To tackle this problem, we propose an inverse design framework (MatDesINNe) utilizing invertible neural networks which can map both forward and reverse processes between the design space and target property. This approach can be used to generate materials candidates for a designated property, thereby satisfying the highly sought-after goal of inverse design. We then apply this framework to the task of band gap engineering in two-dimensional materials, starting with MoS
              2
              . Within the design space encompassing six degrees of freedom in applied tensile, compressive and shear strain plus an external electric field, we show the framework can generate novel, high fidelity, and diverse candidates with near-chemical accuracy. We extend this generative capability further to provide insights regarding metal-insulator transition in MoS
              2
              which are important for memristive neuromorphic applications, among others. This approach is general and can be directly extended to other materials and their corresponding design spaces and target properties.},

The design of such materials is challenged by the multifunctionality requirements and various constraints stemmed from manufacturing limitations and other practical considerations. Traditional design methods such as those based on topological optimization techniques rely heavily on high-dimensional physical simulations and can be inefficient. In addition, it is difficult to impose geometrical constraints in those methods. In this work, we propose a deep learning model based on deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for the design of microstructural materials. The DCGAN is used to generate design candidates that satisfy geometrical constraints and the CNN is used as a surrogate model to link the microstructure to its properties. Once trained, the two networks are combined to form the design network which is utilized to for the inverse design. The advantages of the method include its high efficiency and the simplicity in handling geometrical constraints. In addition, no high-dimensional sensitivity simulations are required. The performance of the method is demonstrated on the design of microstructural materials with desired compliance tensor, subject to specified geometrical constraints.},

	abstract = {Metamaterials are emerging as a new paradigmatic material system to render unprecedented and tailorable properties for a wide variety of engineering applications. However, the inverse design of metamaterial and its multiscale system is challenging due to high-dimensional topological design space, multiple local optima, and high computational cost. To address these hurdles, we propose a novel data-driven metamaterial design framework based on deep generative modeling. A variational autoencoder (VAE) and a regressor for property prediction are simultaneously trained on a large metamaterial database to map complex microstructures into a low-dimensional, continuous, and organized latent space. We show in this study that the latent space of VAE provides a distance metric to measure shape similarity, enable interpolation between microstructures and encode meaningful patterns of variation in geometries and properties. Based on these insights, systematic data-driven methods are proposed for the design of microstructure, graded family, and multiscale system. For microstructure design, the tuning of mechanical properties and complex manipulations of microstructures are easily achieved by simple vector operations in the latent space. The vector operation is further extended to generate metamaterial families with a controlled gradation of mechanical properties by searching on a constructed graph model. For multiscale metamaterial systems design, a diverse set of microstructures can be rapidly generated using VAE for target properties at different locations and then assembled by an efficient graph-based optimization method to ensure compatibility between adjacent microstructures. We demonstrate our framework by designing both functionally graded and heterogeneous metamaterial systems that achieve desired distortion behaviors.},

In computational material science, generating microstructure is a crucial step in understanding the relationship between the microstructure and properties. However, using finite element (FE)-based direct numerical simulation (DNS) of microstructure for multiscale analysis is extremely resource-intensive, particularly in iterative calculations. To address this time-consuming issue, this study employs a diffusion-based generative model as a replacement for computational analysis in design optimization. The model learns the geometry of microstructure and corresponding stress contours, allowing for the prediction of microstructural behavior based solely on geometry, without the need for additional analysis. The focus on this work is on mechanoluminescence (ML) particulate composites made with europium ions and dysprosium ions. Multi-objective optimization is conducted based on the generative diffusion model to improve light sensitivity and fracture toughness. The results show multiple candidates of microstructure that meet the design requirements. Furthermore, the designed microstructure is not present in the training data but generates new morphology following the characteristics of particulate composites. The proposed approach provides a new way to characterize a performance-based microstructure of composite materials.},

The proposed methodology resolves this issue by learning a unified feature space that embodies diverse structural patterns with continuously varying stochasticity levels. A highly diverse microstructure database is established to incorporate various types of deterministic and stochastic microstructure patterns. A property-aware deep generative model is proposed to learn a unified feature space of the structural characteristics, as well as the relationship between structure features and properties of interest. Autoencoder (AE), Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE) are compared to understand their relative merits in the property-aware learning of the unified feature space. Microstructural designs with tailorable stochasticity and properties are obtained by searching the unified feature space. Multiple design cases are presented to demonstrate the capability of designing microstructures for structural stochasticity and properties. Furthermore, the proposed method is employed to create stochastically graded structures, which manipulate the mechanical behaviors by varying the local stochasticity of the structure.},

Such shocks can explain over 20\% of the forecasting error variance of non-fundamental house price runups in Ireland and Spain. We find that, in countries with more regulated mortgage markets, monetary policy stance does not significantly affect non-fundamental house prices.

	abstract = {Composites with extremal or unusual thermal expansion coefficients are designed using a three-phase topology optimization method. The composites are made of two different material phases and a void phase. The topology optimization method consists in finding the distribution of material phases that optimizes an objective function (e.g. thermoelastic properties) subject to certain constraints, such as elastic symmetry or volume fractions of the constituent phases, within a periodic base cell. The effective properties of the material structures are found using the numerical homogenization method based on a finite-element discretization of the base cell. The optimization problem is solved using sequential linear programming. To benchmark the design method we first consider two-phase designs. Our optimal two-phase microstructures are in fine agreement with rigorous bounds and the so-called Vigdergauz microstructures that realize the bounds. For three phases, the optimal microstructures are also compared with new rigorous bounds and again it is shown that the method yields designed materials with thermoelastic properties that are close to the bounds. The three-phase design method is illustrated by designing materials having maximum directional thermal expansion (thermal actuators), zero isotropic thermal expansion, and negative isotropic thermal expansion. It is shown that materials with effective negative thermal expansion coefficients can be obtained by mixing two phases with positive thermal expansion coefficients and void.},

The goal was to determine the optimal distribution of material phase within the periodic base cell. Maximizing bulk modulus or shear modulus was selected as the objective of the material design subject to an isotropy constraint and a volume constraint. The effective properties of the material were found using the homogenization method based on finite element analyses of the base cell. The proposed BESO procedure utilizes the gradient-based sensitivity method to impose the isotropy constraint and gradually evolve the microstructures of cellular materials to an optimum. Numerical examples show the computational efficiency of the approach. A series of new and interesting microstructures of isotropic cellular materials that maximize the bulk or shear modulus have been found and presented. The methodology can be extended to incorporate other material properties of interest such as designing isotropic cellular materials with negative Poisson's ratio.},

	abstract = {This paper is devoted to the analytical and numerical study of isotropic elastic composites made of three or more isotropic phases. The ranges of their effective bulk and shear moduli are restricted by the Hashin–Shtrikman–Walpole (HSW) bounds. For two-phase composites, these bounds are attainable, that is, there exist composites with extreme bulk and shear moduli. For multiphase composites, they may or may not be attainable depending on phase moduli and volume fractions. Sufficient conditions of attainability of the bounds and various previously known and new types of optimal composites are described. Most of our new results are related to the two-dimensional problem. A numerical topology optimization procedure that solves the inverse homogenization problem is adopted and used to look for two-dimensional three-phase composites with a maximal effective bulk modulus. For the combination of parameters where the HSW bound is known to be attainable, new microstructures are found numerically that possess bulk moduli close to the bound. Moreover, new types of microstructures with bulk moduli close to the bound are found numerically for the situations where the aforementioned attainability conditions are not met. Based on the numerical results, several new types of structures that possess extremal bulk modulus are suggested and studied analytically. The bulk moduli of the new structures are either equal to the HSW bound or higher than the bulk modulus of any other known composite with the same phase moduli and volume fractions. It is proved that the HSW bound is attainable in a much wider range than it was previously believed. Results are readily applied to two-dimensional three-phase isotropic conducting composites with extremal conductivity. They can also be used to study transversely isotropic three-dimensional three-phase composites with cylindrical inclusions of arbitrary cross-sections (plane strain problem) or transversely isotropic thin plates (plane stress or bending of plates problems).},

	abstract = {Metamaterials are defined as a family of rationally designed artificial materials which can provide extraordinary effective properties compared with their nature counterparts. This paper proposes a level set based method for topology optimization of both single and multiple-material Negative Poisson’s Ratio (NPR) metamaterials. For multi-material topology optimization, the conventional level set method is advanced with a new approach exploiting the reconciled level set (RLS) method. The proposed method simplifies the multi-material topology optimization by evolving each individual material with a single level set function and reconciling the result level set field with the Merriman–Bence–Osher (MBO) operator. The NPR metamaterial design problem is recast as a variational problem, where the effective elastic properties of the spatially periodic microstructure are formulated as the strain energy functionals under uniform displacement boundary conditions. The adjoint variable method is utilized to derive the shape sensitivities by combining the general linear elastic equation with a weak imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions. The design velocity field is constructed using the steepest descent method and integrated with the level set method. Both single and multiple-material mechanical metamaterials are achieved in 2D and 3D with different Poisson’s ratios and volumes. Benchmark designs are fabricated with multi-material 3D printing at high resolution. The effective auxetic properties of the achieved designs are verified through finite element simulations and characterized using experimental tests as well.},

In order to empower the developed framework for performing crashworthiness studies, the effect of the dynamic energy density content on the microscale fracture modes of CMCs is also considered. The CDM model is developed within a physically consistent framework that includes basic fracture mechanics of CMCs. Also the CDM model is developed in such a way that most of the material parameters are directly obtainable form the experimental data rather than cumbersome and time consuming numerical curve ﬁtting techniques. In order to construct a computationally effective multiscale analysis platform for CMCs, this work aims to provide an asymptotic solution for a microscale representative volume element (RVE) which represents the ﬁber, interphase and matrix interactions. The developed asymptotic solution can capture the non-linear response of CMCs through CDM model; and it considerably reduces the computational cost of hierarchical multiscale analysis in comparison to the numerical methods, e.g. numerical models that simulate the real microstructure. The CDM model and the RVE asymptotic solution are utilized to study the microscale damage mechanisms in CMC systems. It is shown that the developed scheme performs quite well in capturing available experiments in the literature and provides a comprehensive description of microscale damage mechanisms in CMCs. The developed framework can be utilized in the future developments of the hierarchical multiscale analysis of CMC systems.},

	abstract = {A hierarchical multiscale modeling approach is used to investigate three-dimensional (3D) strain localization in granular media. Central to the multiscale approach is a hierarchical coupling of finite element method (FEM) and discrete element method (DEM), wherein the FEM is employed to treat a boundary value problem of a granular material and the required constitutive relation for FEM is derived directly from the DEM solution of a granular assembly embedded at each of the FEM Gauss integration points as the representative volume element (RVE). While being effective in reproducing the complex mechanical responses of granular media, the hierarchical approach helps to bypass the necessity of phenomenological constitutive models commonly needed by conventional FEM studies and meanwhile offers a viable way to link the macroscopic observations with their underlying microscopic mechanisms. To model the phenomenon of strain localization, key issues pertaining to the selection of proper RVE packings are first discussed. The multiscale approach is then applied to simulate the strain localization problem in a cubical specimen and a cylindrical specimen subjected to either conventional triaxial compression (CTC) or conventional triaxial extension (CTE) loading, which is further compared to a case under plane-strain biaxial compression (PBC) loading condition. Different failure patterns, including localized, bulging and diffuse failure modes, are observed and analyzed. Amongst all testing conditions, the PBC condition is found most favorable for the formation of localized failure. The CTC test on the cubical specimen leads to a 3D octopus-shaped localization zone, whereas the cylindrical specimen under CTC shows seemingly bulging failure from the outlook but rather more complex failure patterns within the specimen. The CTE test on a uniform specimen normally ends in a diffuse failure. Different micro mechanisms and controlling factors underlying the various interesting observations are examined and discussed.},

This technique involves modeling the fabric using a yarn level architecture around the impact region and a homogenized or membrane type architecture at far field regions. The level of modeling resolution decreases with distance away from the impact zone. This results in a finite element model with much lower computational requirements. The yarns are modeled using both solid and shell finite elements. Impedances are matched across all interfaces created between the various regions of the model to prevent artificial reflections of the longitudinal strain waves. A systematic approach is presented to determine geometric and material parameters of the homogenized zone. The multiscale model is extensively validated against baseline models. The limitations of using shell elements to model the yarn level architecture underneath the projectile are addressed.},

In this work, microstructure-based simulations with model parameters calibrated to reproduce experimental data are employed to make a qualitative assessment of how physical variables of dual-phase steel are correlated to its properties. Afterward, the linkages between physical variables of dual phase steel to its property are computed with a limited amount of microstructure-based simulation data by adopting the Bayesian approach, namely Gaussian process regression (GPR). Even with a small amount of data, GPR yielded an impressive level of accuracy.

Microstructure characterization and reconstruction (MCR), coupled with machine learning techniques and materials modeling and simulation, is an important component of discovering PSP relations and inverse material design in the era of high-throughput computational materials science. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of representative approaches for MCR and elaborate on their algorithmic details, computational costs, and how they fit into the PSP mapping problems. Multiple categories of MCR methods relying on statistical functions (such as n-point correlation functions), physical descriptors, spectral density function, texture synthesis, and supervised/unsupervised learning are reviewed. As no MCR method is applicable to the analysis and (inverse) design of all material systems, our goal is to provide the scientific community with a close examination of the state-of-the-art techniques for MCR, as well as useful guidance on which MCR method to choose and how to systematically apply it to a problem at hand. We illustrate applications of MCR on materials modeling and building structure-property relations via two examples: One on learning the materials law of a class of composite microstructures, and the second on relating the permittivity and dielectric loss to a structural parameter in nanodielectrics.},

The safety and performance requirements of critical components, as well as the cost of material and machining of Titanium components, make dovetailing of the microstructure imperative. This paper addresses the optimization of several microstructure design problems for Titanium components under specific design constraints using a feedback-aware data-driven solution methodology. In this study, the microstructure is modeled with an orientation distribution function (ODF) that measures the volumes of different crystallographic orientations. Two algorithms are used to sample the entire microstructure space followed by machine learning-aided identification of a minimal subset of ODF dimensions which is subsequently explored by targeted sampling. Conventional optimization methods lead to a unique microstructure rather than yielding a comprehensive space of optimal or near-optimal microstructures. Multiple solutions are crucial for the deployment of materials design for manufacturing as traditional manufacturing processes can only generate a limited set of microstructures. Our data sampling-based methodology not only outperforms or is on par with other optimization techniques in terms of the optimal property value, but also provides numerous near-optimal solutions, 3–4 orders of magnitude more than previous methods. Consequently, the proposed framework delivers a spectrum of optimal solutions in the microstructure space which can accelerate materials development and reduce manufacturing costs.},

Most previous efforts in this direction have relied on feature design (i.e., the identification of the salient features of the material microstructure to be included in the PSP linkages). However due to the rich complexity of features in most heterogeneous materials systems, it has been difficult to identify a set of consistent features that are transferable from one material system to another. With flexible architecture and remarkable learning capability, the emergent deep learning approaches offer a new path forward that circumvents the feature design step. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of a deep learning feature-engineering-free approach to the prediction of the microscale elastic strain field in a given three-dimensional voxel-based microstructure of a high-contrast two-phase composite.

The samples were deformed in the temperature range from 1100 to 1250 °C with an interval of 50 °C, strain rate ranging from 0.01 to 1 s−1 and the height reduction of 50\% using Gleeble-3800 thermal–mechanical simulator. By using this experimental data an artificial neural network (ANN) model was developed and evaluated with unseen data. Further, the developed ANN model was used to predict flow stress correction from adiabatic heating at finer intervals of strain rates and temperatures. The predicted isothermal flow stress values were utilized to construct processing maps for Ti–19Al–22Mo alloy at true strain of 0.4 and 0.6. The maximum efficiency was noticed at 1100 °C with the strain rate of 0.01 s−1 associated with dynamic recrystallization and dynamic recovery. The deformation conditions of the instability domains in processing map showed wedge cracking and flow localization. Using the processing maps safe working parameters for hot deformation of Ti–19Al–22Mo alloy was identified.},

Nevertheless, the computational cost restrains the application of full-field simulations in optimizing materials microstructures or in establishing comprehensive structure-property linkages. To address this issue, we propose the use of machine learning technique, namely Gaussian process regression, with a small number of full-field simulation results to construct structure-property linkages that are accurate over a wide range of microstructures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that with the implementation of expected improvement algorithm, microstructures that exhibit most desirable properties can be identified using even smaller number of full-field simulations.},

	abstract = {A bottom-up multi-scale modeling approach is used to develop an Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME) framework for carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites, which has the potential to reduce development to deployment lead time for structural applications in lightweight vehicles. In this work, we develop and integrate computational models comprising of four size scales to fully describe and characterize three types of CFRP composites. In detail, the properties of the interphase region are determined by an analytical gradient model and molecular dynamics analysis at the nano-scale, which is then incorporated into micro-scale unidirectional (UD) representative volume element (RVE) models to characterize the failure strengths and envelopes of UD CFRP composites. Then, the results are leveraged to propose an elasto-plastic-damage constitutive law for UD composites to study the fiber tows of woven composites as well as the chips of sheet molding compound (SMC) composites. Subsequently, the failure mechanisms and failure strengths of woven and SMC composites are predicted by the meso-scale RVE models. Finally, building upon the models and results from lower scales, we show that a homogenized macro-scale model can capture the mechanical performance of a hat-section-shaped part under four-point bending. Along with the model integration, we will also demonstrate that the computational results are in good agreement with experiments conducted at different scales. The present study illustrates the potential and significance of integrated multi-scale computational modeling tools that can virtually evaluate the performance of CFRP composites and provide design guidance for CFRP composites used in structural applications.},

Moreover, with time, the classical materials selection approach is becoming generalized to address concurrent design of microstructure or mesostructure to satisfy product-level performance requirements. Computational materials science and multiscale mechanics models play key roles in evaluating performance metrics necessary to support materials design. The interplay of systems-based design of materials with multiscale modeling methodologies is at the core of materials design.

It is the responsibility of the data analyst to formulate the scientific issue at hand in terms of PC projections, PLS regressions, etc. Ask yourself, or the investigator, why the data matrix was collected, and for what purpose the experiments and measurements were made. Specify before the analysis what kinds of patterns you would expect and what you would find exciting. The results of the analysis depend on the scaling of the matrix, which therefore must be specified. Variance scaling, where each variable is scaled to unit variance, can be recommended for general use, provided that almost constant variables are left unscaled. Combining different types of variables warrants blockscaling. In the initial analysis, look for outliers and strong groupings in the plots, indicating that the data matrix perhaps should be “polished” or whether disjoint modeling is the proper course. For plotting purposes, two or three principal components are usually sufficient, but for modeling purposes the number of significant components should be properly determined, e.g. by cross-validation. Use the resulting principal components to guide your continued investigation or chemical experimentation, not as an end in itself.},

It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the principal components, reduces to solving an eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed that are tailored to various different data types and structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic ideas of PCA, discussing what it can and cannot do. It will then describe some variants of PCA and their application.},

This kind of approach is predictive for different laminate layups and takes also into account the effects of ply failures on the macroscopic behaviour and the final laminate failure. For the first time to our knowledge, the viscosity of the matrix was introduced into the model for a more realistic description of the mesoscopic behaviour, especially for the non-linearity under shear loading. The mesoscopic failure criterion is based on physical principles and makes a distinction between the fibre failure and the interfibre failure modes. In order to describe the progressive failure of a laminate (ply after ply), a progressive degradation model, based on thermodynamical damage models, was developed. The definition of the final failure is also improved in order to predict the final failure more accurately, especially for [±θ]s laminates. Finally, some results (stress vs. strain laminate responses and macroscopic failure envelopes) are presented and compared with test data found in the literature.},

In this view, the difference between mean-ﬁeld methods and belief propagation is not the amount of structure they model, but only the measure of loss they minimize (‘exclusive’ versus ‘inclusive’ Kullback-Leibler divergence). In each case, message-passing arises by minimizing a localized version of the divergence, local to each factor. By examining these divergence measures, we can intuit the types of solution they prefer (symmetry-breaking, for example) and their suitability for different tasks. Furthermore, by considering a wider variety of divergence measures (such as alpha-divergences), we can achieve different complexity and performance goals.},

When the initial design is small or the underlying response surface is complicated this can lead to poor approximations of the code output. In order to improve the ﬁt of the model, sequential design strategies must be employed. In this paper we introduce two simple distance based metrics that can be used to augment an initial design in a batch sequential manner.

Previously, this task was addressed using linear regression approaches on a large training dataset. In this work, it is demonstrated that the use of Gaussian process regression together with a Bayesian sequential design of experiments can lead to autonomous protocols for optimal generation of the training dataset and the development of the model.

In this paper, the influence of meso-structure and damage mechanisms on mechanical behavior of three-dimensional (3D) four-directional braided SiC/SiC composites is systematically investigated by using numerical simulations. First, periodic preform geometry model, also known as representative volume element (RVE), is reconstructed by using micro-computational tomography (μ-CT). Then, two damage mechanics models are employed to establish non-linear behavior of tows and matrix. Moreover, cohesive model is introduced to represent tow/tow and tow/matrix delamination behavior. It is noteworthy that homogenized tow model is derived from micromechanical model on fiber scale. Finally, macro stress-strain and failure behaviors of 3D braided SiC/SiC composites are simulated by meso-scale finite element analysis. Numerically simulated tensile modulus and strength of 3D braided SiC/SiC composites are compared with experimental results, exhibiting good consistency. Numerical simulations revealed failure mechanism and confirmed that, in addition to globally evolved damage process under tensile load, meso-scale preform caused stress concentration and subsequent local rupture behavior. Current research shows that reconstructed textile model realistically describes tensile mechanical behavior and damage evolution of 3D braided SiC/SiC composites.},

The key points to generating DMTs are the efficient and high-precision identification and segmentation of fiber yarns, matrix, and defects in μCT images. Due to the low gray contrast among fiber yarns, traditional threshold segmentation methods cannot effectively obtain the corresponding woven structures. Therefore, a novel deep convolution neural network (DCNN) model with the U-Net architecture is developed to overcome these difficulties. Based on this approach, cross sections and centerlines of fiber yarns are identified and used to reconstruct their 3D architectures. Defects are introduced through the spatial mapping between their locations in μCT images and the 3D meshes of the matrix. The DMTs of a C/SiC woven composite with quantitative matrix porosity defects are established, and a simulation of the composite under tension is presented. The DMTs approach provides new insights into damage and failure analyses of ceramic-matrix composites.},

The test results indicate a strong influence of the weave architecture on the strain distribution of the material. Mesoscale finite element models were established based on the weave architecture of the material. The experimental and simulation results show that: the strain distributions are periodic and fluctuating; the maximum strain fluctuation on the surface is about 30\%, but the deviation of average strain decreases rapidly with the calculated area increase. The strain measurement methods were proposed to obtain the accurate average strain: the size of measurement/calculated area should be twice larger than the unit cell size; much more accurate result could be obtained when the area size is an integer multiple of the unit cell size.},

For asymmetric tilt GBs (ATGBs) in aluminum, models were successfully established connecting the GB macro degrees of freedom (treated as process parameters) and energy (treated as property) to a low-rank GB atomic structure approximation derived from principal component analysis (PCA) of the full ensemble of PCFs aggregated for this study. More specifically, it has been shown that the models produced in this study resulted in average prediction errors less than 13 mJ/m2, which is less than the error associated with the underlying simulations when compared with experiments. This demonstration raises the potential for the development and application of PSP linkages from atomistic simulation datasets, and offers a powerful route for extracting high value actionable and transferrable knowledge from such computations.},

During metal machining, the dynamic recrystallization mechanism causes grain refinement into the sub-micron range. In this study, we investigate the microstructure evolution of oxygen-free high conductivity copper (OFHC Cu) subject to a machining process where the cutting speed and rake angle are controlled to manipulate the process strain, strain rate, and temperatures. Microstructures of the deformed chips are quantified using orientation imaging microscopy and novel statistical descriptors that capture the morphology and local lattice misorientations generated during the several mechanistic stages of the dynamic recrystallization process. Mechanical properties of the resulting chips are quantified using spherical nanoindentation protocols. A multiple output Gaussian process regression model is used to simultaneously model the structure-property evolution, which differs from more common approaches that establish such relationships sequentially. This modeling strategy is particularly attractive since it can flexibly provide both structure and property uncertainty estimates. In addition, the statistical modeling framework allows for the inclusion of multi-fidelity data. The statistical metrics utilized serve as efficient microstructure descriptors, which retain the physics of the observed structures without having to introduce ad hoc microstructure feature definitions.},

Currently employed segmentation approaches require the user to identify and string together a sequence of algorithms (and codes) into customized workflows that need extensive tweaking and optimization (often accomplished through repeated trials) for producing the most reliable results for each set of images. Recent advances in materials characterization instruments have significantly increased the throughput and variety of microscopy images that could be generated in the efforts to document and understand the material internal structure. There is a critical need for a guiding framework for the systematic design of segmentation workflows that can eventually lead to fully automated segmentation workflows. In this work, we propose one such modular framework consisting of five sequential steps that is applicable to segmentation of a broad variety of microscopy images. Each step is designed to accomplish a specific subtask in the overall segmentation using available functions in popular software packages. Furthermore, the modular nature of the framework allows the user to explore alternate functions in each step, while systematically comparing their relative efficacies. We describe this new segmentation framework in this paper and demonstrate its value through case studies involving a variety of microstructures.},

The state-of-the-art sparse GP model introduced by Snelson and Ghahramani in [1] relies on finding a small, representative pseudo data set of m elements (from the same domain as the n available data elements) which is able to explain existing data well, and then uses it to perform inference. This reduces inference and model selection computation time from O(n{\textasciicircum}3) to O(m{\textasciicircum}2n), where m {\textless}{\textless} n. Inter-domain GPs can be used to find a (possibly more compact) representative set of features lying in a different domain, at the same computational cost. Being able to specify a different domain for the representative features allows to incorporate prior knowledge about relevant characteristics of data and detaches the functional form of the covariance and basis functions. We will show how previously existing models fit into this framework and will use it to develop two new sparse GP models. Tests on large, representative regression data sets suggest that significant improvement can be achieved, while retaining computational efficiency.},

Internal state variable theory is implemented to obtain the stress–strain constitutive relationship for damaged ceramic matrix material using damage variables which capture the effects of matrix cracking and nucleation and growth of matrix porosity. Matrix cracking is modeled using a damage variable determined using fracture mechanics and the self-consistent scheme. This methodology provides an effective way to model the effects of matrix cracks which initiate when stress intensity factors exceed the fracture toughness of the material, and whose growth is governed by crack growth kinetics. An additional source of material nonlinearity, matrix porosity, occurs as a result of material diffusion around grain boundaries and is related to the material entropy dissipation. These effects are captured using a porosity state variable that is explicitly related to the volumetric strain. The nonlinear predictive capabilities of the material model are demonstrated for monolithic silicon carbide, unidirectional (UD) carbon fiber/silicon carbide matrix (C/SiC) CMC, and five-harness satin (5HS) woven C/SiC CMC. The model predictions are in excellent agreement with experimental observations for 2D woven C/SiC CMCs from literature.},

In this contribution, a methodology has been developed to arrive at a sufficiently small micro-structural window that can be regarded as a RVE of a non-uniform micro-structure of a ceramic matrix composite (CMC) containing a range of fiber sizes, and fiber-rich and -poor regions at the length scale of about 100 μm. The RVE contains about 250 fibers of 14 μm diameter average size. The absolute size of the RVE is 0.1 mm2. The methodology involves a unique combination of quantitative characterization of geometry and spatial arrangement of micro-structural features using stereological and image analysis techniques, development of computer simulated micro-structure model that is statistically similar to the real micro-structure, finite element (FE)-based simulations of micro-mechanical response on computer-simulated micro-structural widows of different sizes containing 60–2000 fibers, and FE-based simulations on large-area high-resolution digital image of the composite micro-structure containing about 2000 fibers. The RVE has the micro-structure that is statistically similar to that of the CMC having fiber-rich and -poor regions, its Young's modulus is very close to that of the composite, and has local stress distribution that is comparable to that in the real composite under similar loading conditions. Therefore, such an RVE is useful for realistic simulations of damage initiation.},

Second, we derive analytic relationships between the 2-point statistics and the spatially resolved sampled microstructures, within the approximation of a N-output Gaussian Random Field. Finally, we propose the algorithms necessary to efficiently sample these fields in O(SlnS) computational complexity and while incurring O(S) memory cost.

However, the process is relatively new and requires additional investigation to become sufficiently mature for wide scale industrial adoption. Electron beam melting powder bed fusion is one technology that has shown promise for fabricating high temperature resistant materials such as nickel based superalloys. The resulting microstructures typically exhibit a strong fiber texture in the build direction giving rise to anisotropic time-dependent deformation behavior. In order to accelerate the qualification of these materials for industrial adoption accurate numerical models are needed for simulating their behavior. In this work a crystal plasticity model including non-Schmid effects is presented for capturing creep anisotropy observed in additively manufactured IN738LC. The model is calibrated via a probabilistic framework where model parameters are treated as random variables. An iterative sequential design strategy is utilized to efficiently identify the probability density of the unknown model parameters. As a case study the model is utilized to investigate the behavior of randomly oriented equiaxed grain clusters sometimes observed embedded in the additively manufactured columnar structure. A synthetic realization is simulated and uncertainty is propagated through to the full-field response. Results indicate that these features are the source of significant creep relaxation and strain accumulation which partially explains observed grain boundary decohesion at these locations.},

The first of them measures a spatial inhomogeneity, for a binary pattern, or compositional one, for a greyscale image. The second one quantifies a spatial or compositional statistical complexity. The EDs reveal structural information that is dissimilar, at least in part, to that given by correlation functions at almost all discrete length scales. The method is tested on a few digitized binary and greyscale images. In each of the cases, the persuasive reconstruction of the microstructure is found.},

In this contribution, an unbiased, efficient, and robust practical technique is presented for estimation of direction dependent as well as orientation averaged two-point correlation functions in three-dimensional (3D) microstructures from the measurement performed on vertical metallographic planes. It is shown that if the direction dependence of the two-point correlations has an axis of symmetry then measurements on just one vertical plane containing the symmetry axis are sufficient for estimation of the direction dependent as well as mean two-point correlation functions, and measurements on at the most three vertical planes are sufficient if there is no symmetry axis. The new method is applied for characterization of spatial heterogeneity and clustering of SiC particles in a series of DRA composites having different degrees of microstructural heterogeneity and clustering. It is shown that numerous length scale parameters that characterize spatial heterogeneity and clustering can be extracted from the experimental data on two-point correlation functions.},

The method permits the derivation of explicit, fully condensed thermal–mechanical equilibrium equations which are of mathematical exactness in the piece-wise linear sense. The method has been implemented with a 4-node quadrilateral two-dimensional (2D) element and a 4-node tetrahedron three-dimensional (3D) element. It has been demonstrated, through several numerical examples that the new TM-AFEM can provide significantly improved numerical accuracy and efficiency when dealing with crack propagation problems in 2D and 3D solids under coupled thermal–mechanical loading conditions.

	abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a probabilistic nonparametric representation of functions in regression, classiﬁcation, and other problems. Unfortunately, exact learning with GPs is intractable for large datasets. A variety of approximate GP methods have been proposed that essentially map the large dataset into a small set of basis points. Among them, two state-of-the-art methods are sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) (Snelson \& Ghahramani, 2006) and variable-sigma GP (VSGP) Walder et al. (2008), which generalizes SPGP and allows each basis point to have its own length scale. However, VSGP was only derived for regression. In this paper, we propose a new sparse GP framework that uses expectation propagation to directly approximate general GP likelihoods using a sparse and smooth basis. It includes both SPGP and VSGP for regression as special cases. Plus as an EP algorithm, it inherits the ability to process data online. As a particular choice of approximating family, we blur each basis point with a Gaussian distribution that has a full covariance matrix representing the data distribution around that basis point; as a result, we can summarize local data manifold information with a small set of basis points. Our experiments demonstrate that this framework outperforms previous GP classiﬁcation methods on benchmark datasets in terms of minimizing divergence to the non-sparse GP solution as well as lower misclassiﬁcation rate.},

	abstract = {Gaussian process (GP) models are flexible probabilistic nonparametric models for regression, classification and other tasks. Unfortunately they suffer from computational intractability for large data sets. Over the past decade there have been many different approximations developed to reduce this cost. Most of these can be termed global approximations, in that they try to summarize all the training data via a small set of support points. A different approach is that of local regression, where many local experts account for their own part of space. In this paper we start by investigating the regimes in which these different approaches work well or fail. We then proceed to develop a new sparse GP approximation which is a combination of both the global and local approaches. Theoretically we show that it is derived as a natural extension of the framework developed by Qui onero Candela and Rasmussen [2005] for n sparse GP approximations. We demonstrate the benefits of the combined approximation on some 1D examples for illustration, and on some large real-world data sets.},

The mechanical macromodel is based on a partitioning of damage according to the various degradation mechanisms. Analysis windows on the microscale enable the reconstruction of the crack network indicators and of the opening states of the cracks as functions of the loading. The self-healing mechanism is modelled by creating an oxide plug in an open crack and simulating the diffusion of oxygen through its evolving geometry. An evolution law for ﬁbre strength as a function of oxygen concentration provides an illustration of the inﬂuence of complex thermomechanical loading on the composite’s lifetime.},

Additional experiments were conducted in H2O/argon mixtures at a temperature of 1100°C. Experiments were designed to minimize impurity and volatility effects, so that only intrinsic water-vapor effects were observed. The oxidation kinetics increased as the water-vapor content increased. The parabolic oxidation rates in the range of 10-90 vol\% water vapor (the balance being oxygen) were approximately one order of magnitude higher than the rates that were observed in dry oxygen for temperatures of 1200°-1400°C. The power-law dependence of the parabolic oxidation rate on the partial pressure of water vapor at all temperatures of the study indicated that the molecular species was not the sole rate-limiting oxidant. The determination of an activation energy for diffusion was complicated by variations in the oxidation mechanism and oxide-scale morphology with the partial pressure of water vapor and the temperature.},

	abstract = {Asteroseismology of bright stars has become increasingly important as a method to determine the fundamental properties (in particular ages) of stars. The Kepler Space Telescope initiated a revolution by detecting oscillations in more than 500 main-sequence and subgiant stars. However, most Kepler stars are faint and therefore have limited constraints from independent methods such as long-baseline interferometry. Here we present the discovery of solar-like oscillations in α Men A, a naked-eye (V = 5.1) G7 dwarf in TESS’s southern continuous viewing zone. Using a combination of astrometry, spectroscopy, and asteroseismology, we precisely characterize the solar analog α Men A (T eff = 5569 ± 62 K, R ⋆ = 0.960 ± 0.016 R ⊙, M ⋆ = 0.964 ± 0.045 M ⊙). To characterize the fully convective M dwarf companion, we derive empirical relations to estimate mass, radius, and temperature given the absolute Gaia magnitude and metallicity, yielding M ⋆ = 0.169 ± 0.006 M ⊙, R ⋆ = 0.19 ± 0.01 R ⊙, and T eff = 3054 ± 44 K. Our asteroseismic age of 6.2 ± 1.4 (stat) ± 0.6 (sys) Gyr for the primary places α Men B within a small population of M dwarfs with precisely measured ages. We combined multiple ground-based spectroscopy surveys to reveal an activity cycle of P = 13.1 ± 1.1 yr for α Men A, a period similar to that observed in the Sun. We used different gyrochronology models with the asteroseismic age to estimate a rotation period of ∼30 days for the primary. Alpha Men A is now the closest (d = 10 pc) solar analog with a precise asteroseismic age from space-based photometry, making it a prime target for next-generation direct-imaging missions searching for true Earth analogs.},

	abstract = {The central idea proposed here is that, in entropy–producing processes, a specific choice from among a competing class of constitutive functions can be made so that the state variables evolve in a way that maximizes the rate of entropy production. When attention is restricted to quadratic forms for the rate of entropy production, the assumption leads to results that are fully in keeping with linear phenomenological relations that satisfy the Onsager relations. In other words, the usual linear evolution laws such as Fourier's law of heat conduction, Fick's law, Darcy's law, Newton's law of viscosity, etc., all corroborate this assumption. We clarify the difference between the maximum rate of entropy production criterion that characterizes choices among constitutive relations and the minimum entropy production theorem due to Onsager (1931) that characterizes steady states for special choices of the rate of entropy production. We then show that for other forms of entropy production that are not quadratic for which the Onsager relations and related theorems cannot be applied, we can use the procedure described here to obtain nonlinear laws. We demonstrate by means of an example that even yield–type phenomena can be accommodated within this framework, while they cannot within the framework of Onsager. We also discuss issues concerning constraints, especially in thermoelasticity within the context of our ideas.},

	abstract = {This is the second of a two part paper dealing with the inelastic response of materials. Part I (see Rajagopal and Srinivasa, 1998 International Journal of Plasticity 14, 945–967) dealt with the structure of the constitutive equations for the elastic response of a material with multiple natural configurations. We now focus attention on the evolution of the natural configurations. We introduce two functions-the Helmholtz potential and the rate of dissipation function—representing the rate of conversion of mechanical work into heat. Motivated by, and generalizing the work of Ziegler (1963) in Progress in Solid Mechanics, Vol. 4, North-Holland, Amsterdam/New York; (1983) An Introduction to Thermodynamics, North-Holland, Amsterdam/New York) we then assume that the evolution of the natural configurations occurs in such a way that the rate of dissipation is maximized. This maximization is subject to the constraint that the rate of dissipation is equal to the difference between the rate of mechanical working and the rate of increase of the Helmholtz potential per unit volume. This then allows us to derive the constitutive equations for the stress response and the evolution of the natural configurations from these two scalar functions. Of course, the maximum rate of dissipation criterion that is stated here is only an assumption that holds for a certain class of materials under consideration. Our quest is to see whether such an assumption gives reasonable results. In the process, we hope to gain insight into the nature of such materials. We demonstrate that the resulting constitutive equations allow for response with and without yielding behavior and obtain a generalization of the normality and convexity conditions. We also show that, in the limit of quasistatic deformations, if one considers materials that possess yielding behavior, then the constitutive equations reduce to those corresponding to the strain space formulation of the rate independent theory of plasticity (see e.g. Naghdi (1990) Journal of Applied Mathematics and Physics A345, 425–458.). Moreover, in this limit, the maximum rate of dissipation criterion, as stated here, is equivalent to the work inequality of Naghdi and Trapp (1975) Quartely Journal of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics 28, 25–46). The main results together with an illustrative example are presented.},

Indeed, MCMC is indispensable for performing Bayesian analysis. Two critical questions that MCMC practitioners need to address are where to start and when to stop the simulation. Although a great amount of research has gone into establishing convergence criteria and stopping rules with sound theoretical foundation, in practice, MCMC users often decide convergence by applying empirical diagnostic tools. This review article discusses the most widely used MCMC convergence diagnostic tools. Some recently proposed stopping rules with ﬁrm theoretical footing are also presented.

	abstract = {We consider prediction and uncertainty analysis for systems which are approximated using complex mathematical models. Such models, implemented as computer codes, are often generic in the sense that by a suitable choice of some of the model's input parameters the code can be used to predict the behaviour of the system in a variety of specific applications. However, in any specific application the values of necessary parameters may be unknown. In this case, physical observations of the system in the specific context are used to learn about the unknown parameters. The process of fitting the model to the observed data by adjusting the parameters is known as calibration. Calibration is typically effected by ad hoc fitting, and after calibration the model is used, with the fitted input values, to predict the future behaviour of the system. We present a Bayesian calibration technique which improves on this traditional approach in two respects. First, the predictions allow for all sources of uncertainty, including the remaining uncertainty over the fitted parameters. Second, they attempt to correct for any inadequacy of the model which is revealed by a discrepancy between the observed data and the model predictions from even the best-fitting parameter values. The method is illustrated by using data from a nuclear radiation release at Tomsk, and from a more complex simulated nuclear accident exercise.},

A 2.2 yr quasi-periodicity in the γ-ray light curve was detected, possibly a result of jet precession. Motivated by the previous studies based on the γ-ray data, we analyzed the X-ray light curve and spectra observed during 2012–2020. The 2.2 yr quasi-periodicity might be consistent with the main-flare recurrence in the X-ray light curve. When a weak rebrightening in the γ-ray was observed, a corresponding relatively strong brightening in the X-ray light curve can be identified. The harder-when-brighter tendency in both X-ray main and weak flares was shown, as well as a weak softer-when-brighter behavior for the quiescent state. We explore the possibility that the variability in the X-ray band can be interpreted with two-jet precession scenario. Using the relation between jets and accretion disks, we derive the primary black hole mass ≃3.47 × 108 M ☉ and mass of the secondary one ≃1.40 × 108 M ☉, and their mass ratio ∼0.41.},

These theoretical expectations remain untested so far as the detection and characterization of very young planets is extremely challenging due to the intense stellar activity of their host stars3,4. Only the recent discoveries of young planetary transiting systems allow initial constraints to be placed on evolutionary models5–7. With an estimated age of 20 million years, V1298 Tau is one of the youngest solar-type stars known to host transiting planets; it harbours a system composed of four planets, two Neptune-sized, one Saturn-sized and one Jupiter-sized8,9. Here we report a multi-instrument radial velocity campaign of V1298 Tau, which allowed us to determine the masses of two of the planets in the system. We find that the two outermost giant planets, V1298 Tau b and e (0.64 ± 0.19 and 1.16 ± 0.30 Jupiter masses, respectively), seem to contradict our knowledge of early-stages planetary evolution. According to models, they should reach their mass–radius combination only hundreds of millions of years after formation. This result suggests that giant planets can contract much more quickly than usually assumed.},

	abstract = {The simplified viscoelastic continuum damage model (S-VECD) has been widely accepted as a computationally efficient and a rigorous mechanistic model to predict the fatigue resistance of asphalt concrete. It operates in a deterministic framework, but in actual practice, there are multiple sources of uncertainty such as specimen preparation errors and measurement errors which need to be probabilistically characterized. In this study, a Bayesian inference-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is used to quantify the uncertainty in the S-VECD model. The dynamic modulus and cyclic fatigue test data from 32 specimens are used for parameter estimation and predictive envelope calculation of the dynamic modulus, damage characterization and failure criterion model. These parameter distributions are then propagated to quantify the uncertainty in fatigue prediction. The predictive envelope for each model is further used to analyze the decrease in variance with the increase in the number of replicates. Finally, the proposed methodology is implemented to compare three asphalt concrete mixtures from standard testing. The major findings of this study are: (1) the parameters in the dynamic modulus and damage characterization model have relatively strong correlation which indicates the necessity of Bayesian techniques; (2) the uncertainty of the damage characteristic curve for a single specimen propagated from parameter uncertainties of the dynamic modulus model is negligible compared to the difference in the replicates; (3) four replicates of the cyclic fatigue test are recommended considering the balance between the uncertainty of fatigue prediction and the testing efficiency; and (4) more replicates are needed to confidently detect the difference between different mixtures if their fatigue performance is close.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the cyclic behavior under different loading conditions using the kinematic and isotropic hardening theory of steel, a Chaboche viscoplastic material model is employed. The parameters of a constitutive model are usually identiﬁed by minimization of the difference between model response and experimental data. However, measurement errors and differences in the specimens lead to deviations in the determined parameters. In this article, the Choboche model is used and a stochastic simulation technique is applied to generate artiﬁcial data which exhibit the same stochastic behavior as experimental data. Then the model parameters are identiﬁed by applying an estimation using Bayes’s theorem. The Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (TMCMC) is introduced and employed to estimate the model parameters in the Bayesian setting. The uniform distributions of the parameters representing their priors are considered which literally means no knowledge of the parameters is available. Identiﬁed parameters are compared with the true parameters in the simulation, and the efﬁciency of the identiﬁcation method is discussed. In fact, the main purpose of this study is to observe the possibility of identifying the model and hardening parameters of a viscoplastic model as a very high non-linear model with only a surface displacement measurement vector in the Bayesian setting using TMCMC and evaluate the number of measurements needed for a very acceptable estimation of the uncertain parameters of the model.},

	abstract = {The state of materials and accordingly the properties of structures are changing over the period of use, which may inﬂuence the reliability and quality of the structure during its life-time. Therefore, identiﬁcation of the model parameters of the system is a topic which has attracted attention in the content of structural health monitoring. The parameters of a constitutive model are usually identiﬁed by minimization of the difference between model response and experimental data. However, the measurement errors and differences in the specimens lead to deviations in the determined parameters. In this article, the focus is on the identiﬁcation of material parameters of a viscoplastic damaging material using a stochastic simulation technique to generate artiﬁcial data which exhibit the same stochastic behavior as experimental data. It is proposed to use Bayesian inverse methods for parameter identiﬁcation and therefore the model and damage parameters are identiﬁed by applying the Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method (TMCMC) and Gauss-Markov-Kalman ﬁlter (GMKF) approach. Identiﬁed parameters by using these two Bayesian approaches are compared with the true parameters in the simulation and with each other, and the efﬁciency of the identiﬁcation methods is discussed. The aim of this study is to observe which one of the mentioned methods is more suitable and efﬁcient to identify the model and damage parameters of a material model, as a highly non-linear model, using a limited surface displacement measurement vector and see how much information is indeed needed to estimate the parameters accurately.},

Whereas these materials are known for their large-field induced deformation and broad applications in smart structures, the rate-dependent viscoelastic effects are not well understood. To address this issue, we quantify both the hyperelastic and viscoelastic constitutive behavior and use Bayesian uncertainty analysis to assess several key modeling attributes. Specifically, we compare an Ogden-based phenomenological model to a nonaffine hyperelastic model and couple hyperelasticity to both linear and nonlinear viscoelasticity. The utilization of Bayesian statistics is shown to provide insight into quantifying nonlinear viscoelasticity behavior as a function of internal state variables. The results are validated experimentally in the finite deformation regime over a range of stretch rates spanning four orders of magnitude (6.7×10-5–0.67Hz). A unique set of hyperelastic parameters are identified, independent of the stretch rate. In addition, comparisons of the linear and nonlinear viscoelastic models demonstrate a reduction in modeling error by approximately a factor of three. Finally, the viscoelastic time constant is shown to produce an inverse stretch rate power law dependence regardless of which hyperelastic model is used.},

	abstract = {Continuum elastoplastic damage models employing irreversible thermodynamics and internal state variables are developed within two alternative dual frameworks. In a strain [stress]-based formulation, damage is characterized through the effective stress [strain] concept together with the hypothesis of strain [stress] equivalence, and plastic flow is introduced by means of an additive split of the stress [strain] tensor. In a strain-based formulation we redefine the equivalent strain, usually defined as the J2-norm of the strain tensor, as the (undamaged) energy norm of the strain tensor. In a stress-based approach we employ the complementary energy norm of the stress tensor. These thermodynamically motivated definitions result, for ductile damage, in symmetric elastic-damage moduli. For brittle damage, a simple strain-based anisotropic characterization of damage is proposed that can predict crack development parallel to the axis of loading (splitting mode). The strain- and stress-based frameworks lead to dual but not equivalent formulations, neither physically nor computationally. A viscous regularization of strain-based, rate-independent damage models is also developed, with a structure analogous to viscoplasticity of the Perzyna type, which produces retardation of microcrack growth at higher strain rates. This regularization leads to well-posed initial value problems. Application is made to the cap model with an isotropic strain-based damage mechanism. Comparisons with experimental results and numerical simulations are undertaken in Part II of this work.},

Hesitatingly at first, then little by little, other original contributions appear, until a certain threshold is reached. Then, overview articles are printed, conferences are held, and a first mention is made in textbooks, until specialized monographs are written. Continuum darnage mechanics has reached that status now. To analyze or, if possible, to predict the failure of machine parts or other structures is one of the main goals of engineering science. Consequently fracture mechanics became one of its leading branches. It was based on the analysis of existing cracks. However, especially under conditions of cyclic loading, this might be too late to prevent a disaster. Therefore, the question regarding the precursory state, that is, the evolution of intemal darnage before macrocracks become visible, was then posed. One of the successful approaches to the problern was Weibull's theory which examined, in a statistical manner, the "weakest link" in the material volume under consideration. Unfortunately it proved too difficult mathematically to be applied to complicated parts or structures. Therefore it was highly appreciated by the scientific of material community when L. M. Kachanov published in 1958 a simple model darnage which subsequently could be extended to brittle elastic, plastic or viscous materials under all conditions of uniaxial or multiaxial, simple or cyclic loadings, so that it may be considered nearly universal.},

For example, considering damage in metals we can mention creep damage, ductile plastic damage, embrittlement of steels and fatigue damage. To properly estimate the value of damage when designing reliable structures it is necessary to formulate the damage phenomenon in terms of mechanics. Then it is possible to analyse various engineering problems using analytical and computational techniques. During the last two decades the basic principles of continuum damage mechanics were formulated and some special problems were solved. Many scientific papers were published and several conferences on damage mechanics took place. Now continuum damage mechanics is rapidly developing branch of fracture mechanics. This book is probably the first one on the subject; it contains a sys­ tematic description of the basic aspects of damage mechanics and some of its applications. In general, a theoretical description of damage can be rather compli­ cated. The experiments in this field are difficult (especially under multiax­ ial stress and non-proportional loading). Therefore, experimental data, as a rule, are scarce. Determination of functions and constants, which play a role in the complex variants of the theory, from available experimental data is often practically impossible. ix L.M.

	abstract = {Combining with the modified random sequential adsorption algorithms and the microstructure information obtained from substantial PLM images of carbon/carbon (C/C) composites, a strategy is presented for generating the representative volume elements (RVEs) with complex microstructures such as fiber and spatially randomly distributed pores. The formulation of the Minimum Distance Search Method for efficiently checking the intersection of the fibers-pores or pores-pores in the RVEs is discussed. Within the frameworks of elasticity, the effect of volume fraction and aspect ratio of pore inclusions on the effective elastic properties of C/C composites are investigated using the finite element method (FEM) and numerical homogenization method. The validation is performed by comparing the predicted effective elastic modulus against those measured by uniaxial tensile tests. FEM results show that with increase of porosity, the effective elastic properties of C/C composites decreased rapidly. Compared with the transverse elastic of unidirectional C/C composites, the downward trend of elastic properties of the felt C/C composites is more inclined. Furthermore, under a certain porosity, with increase of the aspect ratio, the effective elastic properties of C/C composites increase.},

	abstract = {A new experimental test rig has been used to measure the thermal diffusivity of a fibre-reinforced ceramic matrix composite material (C/C-SiC) using laser pulse heating under conditions of both one-dimensional and three-dimensional heat transfer. To predict these measurements, a microstructural geometric unit cell model of the material has been developed from optical micrographs and which incorporates fibre tows, matrix and interface materials. With the selection of a suitable finite-element mesh to model each material phase and the prescription of appropriate boundary conditions, this model has then been analysed for conditions of steady-state and transient heat conduction. In this way macro-thermal properties have been calculated from the micro-thermal properties of each phase of the composite. The micro-thermal properties deduced from the analyses for these thermal conditions are in close mutual agreement, and within the bounds of numerical error. These results are presented in this paper alongside the experimental measurements. It is concluded that with careful geometric modelling and sensible property data selection, the micro-thermal properties obtained from the unit cell model can accurately predict the experimentally measured macro-thermal properties.},

	abstract = {Brittle solids can be toughened by incorporating ductile inclusions into them. The inclusions bridge the crack and are stretched as the crack opens, absorbing energy which contributes to the toughness. To calculate the contribution to the toughness it is necessary to know the force-displacement curve for an inclusion, constrained (as it is) by the stiff, brittle matrix. Measured force-displacement curves for highly constrained metal wires are described and related to the unconstrained properties of the wire. The constraint was achieved by bonding the wire into a thick-walled glass capillary, which was then cracked in a plane normal to the axis of the wire and tested in tension. Constraint factors as high as 6 were found, but a lesser constraint gives a larger contribution to the toughness. The diameter of the wires (or of the inclusions) plays an important role. Simple, approximate, models for the failure of the wires are developed. The results allow the contribution of ductile particles to the toughness of a brittle matrix composite to be calculated.
Résumé
Il est possible de curcir des matériaux fragiles en leur incorporant des inclusions ductiles. Les inclusions traversent la fissure et s'allongent lorsque la fissure s'ouvre, absorbant de l'énergie qui contribue à la resilience. Pour calculer la contribution à la resilience, il est nécessaire de connaître la courbe force-déplacement d'une inclusion quand elle est contrainte par la matrice fragile et rigide. Nous décrivons les courbes expérimentales force-déplacement de fils métalliques fortement contraints, et nous les relions aux propriétés du fil non contraint. La contrainte est créée en fixant le fil à l'intérieur d'un capillaire en verre à parois épaisses, que l'on écrase ensuite dans un plan perpendiculaire à l'axe du fil, et que l'on déforme en traction. Les facteurs de contrainte peuvent atteindre 6, mais une contrainte moins élevée participe davantage à la resilience. Le diamètre des fils (ou celui des inclusions) joue un rôle important. Nous développons des modèles approchés simples de la rupture des fils. Les résultats permettent de calculer la contribution des particules ductiles à la resilience d'un composite à matrice fragile.
Zusammenfassung
Spröde Festkörper können mit eingebrachten duktilen Einschlüssen gehärtet werden. Wenn sich der Riβ öffnet, überbrücken die Einschlüsse den Riβ, sie werden gedehnt und absorbieren Energie und tragen so zur Festigkeitserhöhung bei. Um dessen Höhe zu berechnen, muβ man die Kraft-Weg-Kurve für einen Einschluβ, eingeengt durch die steife und spröde Matrix, kennen. Die an entsprechenden Metalldrähten gemessenen Kraft-Weg-Kurven werden beschrieben und mit Messungen des Verhaltens freier Drähte verglichen. Die Einschrämkung wurde dadurch erzeugt, daβ der Draht in dickwandige Glaskapillaren eingebettet wurde; diese wurden dann in einer Ebene senkrecht zur Drahtachse gebrochen und im Zugversuch verformt. Es ergeben sich Einschränkungsfaktoren bis zu 6; allerdings tragen geringere Faktoren stärker zur Zähigkeit bei. Der Durchmesser der Drähte (oder der Einschlüsse) ist sehr wichtig. Es werden einfache angenäherte Modelle für den Bruch der Drähte entwickelt. Die Ergebnisse ermöglichen, den Beitrag der duktilen Einschlüsse zur Zähigkeit einer spröden Matrix zu berechnen.},

	abstract = {A model to predict the increase in critical flaw size or stable crack growth potential which can occur by the inclusion of ductile fibers in a brittle matrix is considered. The model is based upon the super-position of two known stress intensity solutions; one for the crack opening mode resulting from a remotely applied stress and the second, an opposing stress intensity that results from a crack closing force exerted by unbroken fibers spanning the crack surfaces. The extent of stable growth possible is computed at the ultimate stress of the brittle phase as functions of fiber strength and of volume fraction for various amounts of fiber rupture. A hot pressed beryllium matrix is used as an example. The crack surface displacement over which a given fiber is capable of deforming without rupture is found to be sensitive to the fiber-matrix interface strength. The factors leading to maximum crack surface displacement without rupture are a high strain hardening capability of the fiber and an interface designed to fail at fiber stresses between yield and ultimate strengths.},

The steel ﬁbre composites are produced from quasi-unidirectional woven (Q-UD) and purely unidirectional (P-UD) ﬁbre architectures in combination with epoxy resin. The main difference in their microstructures is in the ﬁbre distribution. In the Q-UD composite, steel ﬁbres are tightly packed in bundles with 85\% local ﬁbre volume fraction and these bundles are separated by resin rich areas. In P-UD composite, steel ﬁbres are homogeneously distributed through the composite with an average volume fraction of 50\%. With the highly packed ﬁbres, Q-UD composites achieve a higher strain to failure. In-situ characterization of damage development using acoustic emission registration and crack observations on the specimen surface were used to propose a hypothesis to explain the difference in fracture behaviour, caused by the different microstructures.},

The weight losses due to corrosion were recorded. The corroded and control samples were tested under monotonic tensile loading to measure the ultimate stresses and strains. The effect of corrosion on the mechanical properties of the different materials was evaluated. The digital image correlation (DIC) technique was used to investigate the failure mechanism of the corrosion‐damaged specimens.

Starting with a one-dimensional model based on the slow crack growth model originally proposed by Iyengar and Curtin, which is subsequently generalized to three dimensions focusing on the woven composite architecture. The proposed oxidation-assisted rupture model is developed within the framework of continuum damage mechanics where the constitutive equation in the axial tow direction is governed by the continuum damage mechanics variant of the slow crack-growth model and the availability of oxygen to ﬁbers, which in turn depends on the initial matrix pores and subsequent matrix cracking. The constitutive model in the transverse tow directions as well as in the matrix phase outside the tows is assumed to obey a time-independent orthotropic continuum damage mechanics model, but the time-dependent nature of the axial tow model, inevitably causes the time-dependent redistribution of damage in all directions and phases.

	abstract = {Self-healing Ceramic–Matrix Composites (CMCs) are good candidates for structural applications at high temperatures in oxidizing environments. These materials generate complex couplings between the thermal and mechanical ﬁelds. A multiphysics macroscopic model of both the mechanical behavior and the lifetime of CMC structures was proposed previously and was validated on the material’s level. Here its effectiveness in dealing with structural calculations with heterogeneous ﬁelds is analyzed and a nonlocal fracture criterion is proposed for high-gradient cases. All the simulations were carried out using Abaqus/ Standard. The main interest of the model is its ability to predict the evolution of each of the material’s mechanisms throughout the structure until ﬁnal fracture. Another advantage is the ability to predict the fracture zone and the inﬂuence of indentations on the lifetime of the structure (damage tolerance analysis), both of which are very important for industrial developments.},

The present paper investigates the oxidation of the fibers during static fatigue, at temperatures in the intermediate temperature range (500°–800°C). Two oxidation-induced phenomena have been evidenced: the formation of a thin silica film at the surface of fibers and the delayed failure of fiber bundles and single filaments. The stress–rupture time data are interpreted with respect to the chemical and structural characteristics of fibers, and to the oxide film growth rate. The structural analysis of the fibers was carried out using scanning electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy. Delayed failure was found to result from slow crack propagation from surface defects, as a result of the consumption of the free carbon at grain boundaries and the local stresses induced by the SiC→SiO2 transformation at the crack tip. The respective contributions of these phenomena to static fatigue are discussed.},

This effect has been designated as a nuisance by a few authors. The lifetime of SiC (Nicalon) multifilament tows is investigated in static fatigue in air at temperatures in the range of 600°–700°C. The various features that have been identified suggest that delayed failure under low stresses results from a slow-crack-growth mechanism. Analysis of acoustic emission data allows the number of failures during the tests to be determined. Scanning electron microscopy examination of tow fracture surfaces allows typical crack patterns to be identified. A model of delayed failure is proposed. The model is based on the Paris law and on the well-known model of subcritical crack growth devised by Davidge et al. for ceramics. The model takes into account the statistics of fiber failure. The slow-crack-growth constants have been determined from stress-rupture data. Finally, the model allows satisfactory description of the lifetime of tows and prediction of the lifetime of Nicalon/SiC minicomposites.},

Crystallization kinetics for oxidation in wet air were slightly slower than those for dry air. The activation energy of 249 kJ/mol for parabolic oxidation to uncrystallized SiO2 scale in wet air was indistinguishable from that for dry air oxidation, but the pre-exponential factor was {\textasciitilde}2x higher. SiC fiber strength changes with oxidation in dry and wet air were very similar. The fiber strength increased by approximately 10\% for SiO2 scale thickness up to {\textasciitilde}100 nm, and decreased for thicker scales. No significant strength degradation was observed for amorphous scales. All fibers with significantly degraded strength had crystallized or partially crystallized scales.},

The minicomposite systems consisted of a single tow of Nicalon or Hi-Nicalon fibers with carbon or boron nitride (BN) interphases and a chemical-vapor-infiltrated silicon carbide (CVI-SiC) matrix. The stress-rupture results were compared to single-fiber stress-rupture data and composite data in the literature. Severe embrittlement occurred for carbon interphase minicomposites. However, BN interphase minicomposites showed only mild degradation in the rupture properties. This was true even though the BN interphase reacted and vaporized because of water vapor in the atmosphere at intermediate temperatures (700°-950°C) and glass formation occurred at higher temperatures (950°-1200°C). The severe degradation in rupture properties that occurred for carbon interphase composites at intermediate temperatures was due to degradation of the Nicalon-fiber properties from the environment. The rupture properties of the BN-interphase minicomposites were controlled by the fiber rupture properties at temperatures of less than ˜900°C and greater than 1100°C. In the range of ˜900°-1100°C, most fibers fused to the matrix because of a glass layer that formed between the fiber and matrix, resulting in fiber stress concentrations that led to the mild embrittlement of the BN-interphase minicomposites.},

	abstract = {Woven Hi-Nicalon™-reinforced melt-infiltrated SiC-matrix composites were tested under tensile stress-rupture conditions in air at intermediate temperatures. A comprehensive examination of the damage state and the fiber properties at failure was performed. Modal acoustic emission analysis was used to monitor damage during the experiment. Extensive microscopy of the composite fracture surfaces and the individual fiber fracture surfaces was used to determine the mechanisms leading to ultimate failure. The rupture properties of these composites were significantly worse than expected compared with the fiber properties under similar conditions. This was due to the oxidation of the BN interphase. Oxidation occurred through the matrix cracks that intersected the surface or edge of a tensile bar. These oxidation reactions resulted in strong bonding of the fibers to one another at regions of near fiber-to-fiber contact. It was found that two regimes for rupture exist for this material: a high-stress regime where rupture occurs at a fast rate and a low-stress regime where rupture occurs at a slower rate. For the high-stress regime, the matrix damage state consisted of through-thickness cracks. The average fracture strength of fibers that were pulled out (the final fibers to break before ultimate failure) was controlled by the slow-crack-growth rupture criterion in the literature for individual Hi-Nicalon fibers. For the low-stress regime, the matrix damage state consisted of microcracks which grew during the rupture test. The average fracture strength of fibers that were pulled out in this regime was the same as the average fracture strength of individual fibers pulled out in as-produced composites tested at room temperature.},

	abstract = {Woven silicon carbide fiber-reinforced, silicon carbide matrix composites are leading candidate materials for an advanced jet engine combustor liner application. Although the use temperature in the hot region for this application is expected to exceed 1200 °C, a potential life-limiting concern for this composite system exists at intermediate temperatures (800±200 °C), where significant time-dependent strength degradation has been observed under stress-rupture loading. A number of factors control the degree of stress-rupture strength degradation, the major factor being the nature of the interphase separating the fiber and the matrix. BN interphases are superior to carbon interphases due to the slower oxidation kinetics of BN. A model for the intermediate temperature stress-rupture of SiC/BN/SiC composites is presented based on the observed mechanistic process that leads to strength degradation for the simple case of through-thickness matrix cracks. The approach taken has much in common with that used by Curtin and coworkers, for two different composite systems. The predictions of the model are in good agreement with the rupture data for stress-rupture of both precracked and as-produced composites. Also, three approaches that dramatically improve the intermediate temperature stress-rupture properties are described: Si-doped BN, fiber spreading, and “outside debonding”.},

	abstract = {The degradation of SiC-based ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) in conditions typical of gas turbine engine operation proceeds via the stress rupture of fiber bundles. The degradation is accelerated when oxygen and water invade the composite through matrix microcracks and react with fiber coatings and the fibers themselves. We review micromechanical models of the main rate-determining phenomena involved, including the diffusion of gases and reaction products through matrix microcracks, oxidation of SiC (in both matrix and fibers) leading to the loss of stiffness and strength in exposed fibers, the formation of oxide scale on SiC fiber and along matrix crack surfaces that cause the partial closure of microcracks, and the concomitant and synergistic loss of BN fiber coatings. The micromechanical models could be formulated as time-dependent coupled differential equations in time, which must be solved dynamically, e.g., as an iterated user-defined material element, within a finite element simulation. A paradigm is thus established for incorporating the time-dependent evolution of local material properties according to the local environmental and stress conditions that exist within a material, in a simulation of the damage evolution of a composite component. We exemplify the calibration of typical micromechanical degradation models using thermodynamic data for the oxidation and/or volatilization of BN and SiC by oxygen and water, mechanical test data for the rate of stress rupture of SiC fibers, and kinetic data for the processes involved in gas permeation through microcracks. We discuss approaches for validating computational simulations that include the micromechanical models of environmental degradation. A special challenge is achieving validated predictions of trends with temperature, which are expected to vary in a complex manner during use.},

For this purpose, stress rupture tests were conducted under 100\% steam and laboratory air environments at three temperatures, 400 °C, 750 °C, and 950 °C to develop stress versus time to failure relationships. At a given stress level, time to failure decreased with increase of the test temperature and moisture. However, the stress rupture strength at 750 °C under both laboratory air and steam conditions was relatively low than the expected degradation based on the interpolation from those at 400–950 °C. Similar characteristics were observed in residual strength of the corresponding specimens which survived 100 h and also in the damage mechanisms. The degradation of the BN interphase between the ﬁber and the matrix was the primary damage which was relatively more in the steam environment than that in air laboratory. This damage was in the form of fracture, recession and loss of BN interphase at 400 °C or 950 °C while there was pesting of ﬁbers due to formation of borosilicate causing relatively more embrittlement of the tested CMC system at 750 °C.},

	abstract = {SiC and Si3N4 materials were tested under various turbine engine combustion environments, chosen to represent either conventional fuel-lean or fuel-rich mixtures proposed for high speed aircraft. Representative CVD, sintered, and composite materials were evaluated in both furnace and high pressure burner rig exposure. While protective SiO2 scales form in all cases, evidence is presented to support paralinear growth kinetics, i.e. parabolic growth moderated simultaneously by linear volatilization. The volatility rate is dependent on temperature, moisture content, system pressure, and gas velocity. The burner tests were used to map SiO2 volatility (and SiC recession) over a range of temperature, pressure, and velocity. The functional dependency of material recession (volatility) that emerged followed the form: exp(-Q/RT) * Px * vy. These empirical relations were compared to rates predicted from the thermodynamics of volatile SiO and SiOxHv reaction products and a kinetic model of diffusion through a moving boundary layer. For typical combustion conditions, recession of 0.2 to 2 µm/h is predicted at 1200-1400°C, far in excess of acceptable long term limits.},

The engine Overall Pressure Ratio (OPR) and Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) are being increased in the pursuit of increasing the engine thermal efﬁciency. However, this has an adverse effect on engine NOx emission. The current paper investigates a possible solution to overcome this problem for future generation Very High Bypass Ratio (VHBR)/Ultra High Bypass Ratio (UHBR) aero-engines in the form of an Inter-stage Turbine Burner (ITB). The ITB concept is investigated on a next generation baseline VHBR aero engine to evaluate its effect on the engine performance and emission characteristics for different ITB energy fractions. It is found that the ITB can reduce the bleed air required for cooling the HPT substantially (around 80\%) and also reduce the NOx emission signiﬁcantly ({\textgreater}30\%) without penalising the engine speciﬁc fuel consumption.},

	abstract = {Quantitative relationships between the complex porous structure of a membrane (henceforth simply referred to as microstructure) and its effective permeability are critical for improving the performance of membranes used in filtration and separation applications. This paper presents a digital workflow for learning the porous structure-permeability linkages in membranes. The presented workflow establishes the desired linkages by bringing together recent advances in (i) digital generators for three-dimensional representative volume elements (3-D RVEs) reflecting a large and diverse set of porous structures, (ii) numerical approaches for reliable evaluation of permeability of 3D-RVEs, (iii) low dimensional representation of material internal structure using the framework of 2-point spatial correlations and principal component analyses, and (iv) Gaussian process (GP) regression with input-dependent noise (i.e., heteroscedasticity). It is seen that the digital workflow presented in this study can systematically identify the salient features of the 3-D membrane microstructure and train reduced-order heteroscedastic GP models on the data generated using digital microstructure generators and physics-based permeability simulations. It will be shown that the structure-property linkages are able to make high fidelity predictions and assessment of uncertainties for new porous membrane structures at minimal computational cost.},

It is very useful, especially for the industrial applications where training samples are expensive, time-consuming, or difficult to obtain. Existing methods mainly focus on active learning for classification, and a few methods are designed for regression such as linear regression or Gaussian process. Uncertainties from measurement errors and intrinsic input noise inevitably exist in the experimental data, which further affects the modeling performance. The existing active learning methods do not incorporate these uncertainties for Gaussian process. In this paper, we propose two new active learning algorithms for the Gaussian process with uncertainties, which are variance-based weighted active learning algorithm and D-optimal weighted active learning algorithm. Through numerical study, we show that the proposed approach can incorporate the impact from uncertainties, and realize better prediction performance.

The search in model space (i.e., the space of architectures, noise models, preprocessings, regularizers, and weight decay constants) also then can be treated as an inference problem, in which we infer the relative probability of alternative models, given the data. This provides powerful and practical methods for controlling, comparing, and using adaptive network models. This chapter describes numerical techniques based on Gaussian approximations for implementation of these methods.},

More specifically, these concepts deal with features engineering the heterogeneous material internal structure to obtain low-dimensional representations that can then be combined with machine learning models to establish low-computational cost surrogate models for capturing the process–structure–property linkages over a hierarchy of material structure/lengths scales. Generally referred to as materials knowledge systems (MKS), this framework synergistically leverages the emergent AI/ML (machine learning) toolsets in conjunction with the modern experimental and physics-based simulation toolsets employed currently by the domain experts in the materials field. The primary goal of this tutorial is to present to the domain expert the foundations needed to understand and take advantage of the impending opportunities arising from a synergistic integration of AI/ML tools into the current materials innovation efforts while identifying a specific path forward for accomplishing this goal.},

Simulations conducted on high performance computers have enabled the resolution of relatively large material volumes and have generated big datasets. Although such computations have captured faithfully the many features observed in the corresponding experiments, there has not yet been a broadly adopted framework to quantitatively analyze the predicted material structures and compare them rigorously with experiments. This paper demonstrates that the recently developed framework for the quantification of the material structure, based on the concepts of 2-point spatial correlations and principal component analyses (PCA), can address this critical need. It is further demonstrated that the adoption of a rigorous framework for structure quantification can help to establish objectively many of the modeling parameters and choices made in the simulations.},

	abstract = {Creep behavior in interlaminar shear of an oxide-oxide ceramic composite was investigated at 1100°C in laboratory air and in steam. The Nextel™720/aluminosilicate (N720/AS) composite studied in this effort consists of a porous aluminosilicate matrix reinforced with laminated, woven mullite/alumina Nextel™720 fibers, has no fiber coating, and relies on the porous matrix for flaw tolerance. The interlaminar shear properties were measured. The interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) was determined as 7.65 MPa. The creep behavior was examined for interlaminar shear stresses in the 2-6 MPa range. Primary and secondary creep regimes were observed in all tests conducted in air and in steam. Tertiary creep was noted in the tests performed at 6 MPa. Creep run-out, defined as 100 h at creep stress, was not achieved in any of the tests. Larger creep strains and higher creep strain rates were produced in steam. Surprisingly, the presence of steam had a beneficial effect on creep lifetimes. Composite microstructure, as well as damage and failure mechanisms were investigated. It appears that matrix strengthening occurred in steam, which resulted in longer creep lifetimes in interlaminar shear.
Additionally, exploratory tension-torsion tests of thin-walled tubular specimens of the N720/AS composite were performed at room temperature in laboratory air. These tests were complemented with uniaxial compression tests designed to measure compressive strength of the composite. The failure stress levels determined in combined tension-torsion tests and in compression tests were used together with data from literature to construct a biaxial failure envelope. The efficacy of Tsai-Wu and Tsai-Hill multiaxial failure theories in predicting failure of the oxide-oxide N720/AS CMC was also explored.},

This study is the ﬁrst ever biaxial (tension-torsion) testing of an oxide-oxide porous matrix ceramic matrix composite (CMC) (NextelTM 720/AS) thin wall tube with a novel involute layup. Tests included pure torsion and biaxial (tension-torsion) loading. Strain gage instrumentation was used in addition to Digital Image Correlation (DIC) as a full ﬁeld strain measurement tool to detect crack initiation and propagation. Room temperature and 1100◦C uniaxial tests were performed in a build up approach prior to biaxial (tension-torsion) testing. Straight-sided (matrix-dominated) and dogbone-shaped (ﬁber-dominated) test coupons were tested at room temperature with Digital Image Correlation (DIC) as well as at elevated temperatures of 1100◦C to predict biaxial (tension-torsion) failure loads and develop critical biaxial thin wall tube test procedures. Elevated temperatures of 1100◦C yielded higher ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and lower failure strains, both qualitatively, than room temperature specimen tests. Double-notch shear (DNS) specimens at 1100◦C in air were used to obtain interlaminar shear strength (ILSS). Creep properties at 1100◦C in air and steam were also studied.},

One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to \${\textbackslash}sim N{\textasciicircum}2\$ for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

Older methods for statistical calibration are reviewed before turning to recent work in which the calibration problem is embedded in a Gaussian process model.

	abstract = {Unit-cell homogenization techniques are frequently used together with the finite element method to compute effective mechanical properties for a wide range of different composites and heterogeneous materials systems. For systems with very complicated material arrangements, mesh generation can be a considerable obstacle to usage of these techniques. In this work, pixel-based (2D) and voxel-based (3D) meshing concepts borrowed from image processing are thus developed and employed to construct the finite element models used in computing the micro-scale stress and strain fields in the composite. The potential advantage of these techniques is that generation of unit-cell models can be automated, thus requiring far less human time than traditional finite element models. Essential ideas and algorithms for implementation of proposed techniques are presented. In addition, a new error estimator based on sensitivity of virtual strain energy to mesh refinement is presented and applied. The computational costs and rate of convergence for the proposed methods are presented for three different mesh-refinement algorithms: uniform refinement; selective refinement based on material boundary resolution; and adaptive refinement based on error estimation.

	abstract = {There has been a growing recognition of the opportunities afforded by advanced data science and informatics approaches in addressing the computational demands of modeling and simulation of multiscale materials science phenomena. More specifically, the mining of microstructure–property relationships by various methods in machine learning and data mining opens exciting new opportunities that can potentially result in a fast and efficient material design. This work explores and presents multiple viable approaches for computationally efficient predictions of the microscale elastic strain fields in a three-dimensional (3-D) voxel-based microstructure volume element (MVE). Advanced concepts in machine learning and data mining, including feature extraction, feature ranking and selection, and regression modeling, are explored as data experiments. Improvements are demonstrated in a gradually escalated fashion achieved by (1) feature descriptors introduced to represent voxel neighborhood characteristics, (2) a reduced set of descriptors with top importance, and (3) an ensemble-based regression technique.},

	abstract = {Polymer-based composite materials are being used extensively in semiconductor packaging as thermal interface materials. In the flip-chip technology these materials are inserted between the chip and the heat spreader and also between the heat spreader and heat sink. The composites generally have a polymer base and highly conducting ceramic particles as fillers. The size of the filler particles affects the impact of the thermal boundary resistance between the particles and the matrix, R b , and hence the overall thermal conductivity of the composite, k . We have modeled the composite using percolation theory to study the dependence of thermal conductivity and percolation threshold on the particle Biot number, which is a way to take into account the effect of particle size and R b on k . The temperature dependence of R b and the critical diameter are also studied using the acoustic mismatch model (AMM) for a polyethylene matrix with alumina particles as filler. The results indicate that R b is most important below the percolation threshold, but also that increasing R b tends to increase the percolation threshold. The presence of R b leads to a critical Biot number such that as the Biot number is increased above 1, the composite thermal conductivity is reduced to below that of the matrix, until the percolation threshold is reached.},

	abstract = {The reaction of liquid silicon with glassy carbon and polycrystalline graphite was investigated according to two siliconizing processes. In the first process, the reactants are progressively heated from room temperature up to 1600 °C. In the second one, the liquid silicon is poured onto the carbon sample once the reactants have reached the required temperature, in order to consider short reaction times. Thus, an original equipment consisting of a graphite reactor, has been specially designed for this purpose. The nature and the growth rate of the resulting silicon carbide has been studied using scanning electron microscopy. The results showed the formation of a thin continuous layer of SiC crystallites at the liquid silicon/carbon interface. The thickness of the layer shortly becomes independent of reaction time (about 10 μm on glassy carbon and 15 μm on polycrystalline graphite after 30 min reaction time) while some isolated SiC particles appear in the solidified silicon phase, as well as a regular and unusual time dependent SiC layer at the silicon melt/atmosphere interface.},

However, as the number of phases and components increases, the number of possible patterns that might be obtained during bulk solidification also become larger. While the morphological attributes of binary eutectic solidification have been fairly well understood, the same is not true for ternary and higher multicomponent alloys. In this paper, we study and quantify microstructures in ternary alloys as a function of two essential parameters, namely, the volume fraction of the solid phases and the surface energies of the interfaces (in particular the solid–liquid interfaces). For the selected ensemble of microstructures, quantification and classification were carried out using a recently developed data-driven (objective) approach based on principal component analyses of 2-point correlations. It is demonstrated that the method is capable of analyzing and quantifying the similarity/difference measures between the elements of the selected ensemble of microstructures.},

This paper presents an analysis of interrelations between the complete set of 2-point correlations for composite material systems through their spectral representations via discrete Fourier transforms. These interrelations are used to delineate a compact and convex space that bounds the set of all physically realizable 2-point correlations called the 2-point correlations hull.

It is shown that the correlation functions can be expressed in terms of an intermediate construct, called the texture function; the correlation functions have quadratic dependence in the texture functions. A complete (finite) texture hull is readily constructed for the texture functions in Fourier space, and is found to be a convex polytope. Eigen-texture functions occupy its corner (extreme) points. Microstructure design proceeds directly from homogenization relations evaluated at the corner points. This gives rise to (combined) properties closures, from which second-order microstructure design can proceed. This is demonstrated in a brief case study.},

	abstract = {Fiber-reinforced SiC-based composites are state-of-the-art enabling materials currently being used or developed for high temperature, extreme environment use in aerospace and energy applications. However, the performance of these composites is limited due to strength-degrading oxidation of the non-oxide composite constituents. The form of this degradation depends essentially on three factors: (1) the composite system itself, that is, the composite constituents (and to some extent the fiber architecture (structure) of a specific composite) dictate what reactions can occur with the environment; (2) the applied stress state, which dictates the micro-damage state often responsible for oxygen ingress into a specimen; and (3) the thermochemical environment, which contains the oxidizing species or other more corrosive species. The rates of oxidation, time-temperature damage progression, and fiber-strength degradation all depend on these three factors as well. This chapter will discuss the mechanisms causing stressed-oxidation degradation in SiC-based composites as well as the stress-oxidative behavior of specific composite systems. In addition, modeling and design approaches will be discussed as a means to establish life-prediction methodologies critical for ultimate use of these types of materials in critical applications.},

Our main interest in this paper lies in establishing and demonstrating protocols for high-throughput evaluation of the local mechanical responses in PMCs at a length scale larger than the fiber diameter but smaller than the individual laminate (i.e., ply) thickness. This goal was accomplished in this work through a successful extension of the spherical indentation stress–strain protocols demonstrated recently for metallic samples. Specifically, plies with fibers at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° to the indentation direction were tested, and the means and standard deviations of their indentation moduli and the indentation yield strengths were measured and reported in this paper. The measured values of the indentation moduli were validated with finite element (FE) simulations performed using estimated values of the effective single laminate stiffness parameters. Furthermore, the measured variation in the indentation moduli was shown to correlate extremely well with the corresponding FE predictions that accounted for the measured variation in the local fiber volume fractions in the primary indentation deformed zones in the sample. These comparisons provided strong support for the validity of the extended spherical indentation protocols developed in this work for PMC samples.},

The first step established a surrogate model to capture the dependence of the indentation elastic modulus on the grain (i.e., crystal lattice) orientation and values of single-crystal elastic constants. The second step involved the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo to establish distributions on the elastic constants consistent with experimentally measured indentation moduli in grains of different orientations. The present study refines the second step in order to sequentially identify specific grains that should be indented to provide the most utility in improving the estimated distributions on the elastic constants. The proposed workflow is demonstrated for the extraction of elastic constants for an as-cast cubic polycrystalline Fe-3\%-Si sample.},

The DM has a dual-layer structure composed of a macro-substrate referred to as the gas diffusion layer (GDL) coated with a micro-porous layer (MPL). Efficient prediction of the effective transport properties of the DM from its internal structure is essential to optimizing the multifunctional characteristics of this critical component. In this work, a unique data-driven approach to establishing structure–property correlations is introduced and applied to the case of gas diffusion in the GDL and MPL. This new approach provides an automated process to produce unbiased estimators to microstructural variance, in contrast to many process-related (hence biased) parameters employed by prominent correlations in the field. The present approach starts with a rigorous quantification of microstructure in the form of n-point statistics. It is followed by the identification of the key aspects of the internal structure through the use of principle component analysis. A data-driven correlation is established when the principal components are related to effective diffusivity by multivariate linear regression. This data-driven approach is compared to the conventional correlations and shown to achieve a very high accuracy for capturing the diffusive transport in the tested PEFC components.},

	abstract = {The transition fatigue regime between low cycle fatigue (LCF) and high cycle fatigue (HCF) is often addressed in the design and performance evaluation of load-bearing components used in many structural applications. Transition fatigue is characterized by elevated levels of local inelastic deformation in significant regions of the microstructure as compared to HCF. Typically, crystal plasticity finite element method (CPFEM) simulations are performed to model this phenomenon and to rank-order microstructures by their resistance to crack formation and early growth in the regime of transition fatigue. Unfortunately, these approaches require significant computational resources, inhibiting their use to explore novel materials for transition fatigue resistance. Reduced-order, microstructure-sensitive models are needed to accelerate the search for next-generation, fatigue-resistant materials. In a recent study, Paulson et al. (2018) extended the materials knowledge system (MKS) framework for rank-ordering the HCF resistance of polycrystalline microstructures. The efficacy of this approach lies in the reduced-dimensional representation of microstructures through 2-point spatial correlations and principal component analysis (PCA), in addition to the characterization of the HCF response with a small set of performance measures. In this work, these same protocols are critically evaluated for their applicability to rank-order the transition fatigue resistance of the same class of polycrystalline microstructures subjected to increased strain amplitudes. Success in this endeavor requires the formation of homogenization linkages that account for the significantly higher levels of local inelastic deformation and stress redistribution in transition fatigue as compared to HCF. A set of 12 α-titanium microstructures generated using the open access DREAM.3D software (Groeber and Jackson, 2014) are employed for this evaluation.},

	abstract = {Computationally efficient estimation of the fatigue response of polycrystalline materials is critical for the development of next generation materials in application domains such as transportation, health, security, and energy industries. This is non-trivial for fatigue of polycrystalline metals since the initiation and growth of fatigue cracks depends strongly on attributes of the microstructure, such as the sizes, shapes, orientations, and neighbors of individual grains. Furthermore, regions of microstructure most likely to initiate cracks correspond to the tails of the distributions of the microstructure features. This requires the execution of large numbers of experiments or simulations to capture the response of the material in a statistically meaningful manner. In this work, a linkage is described to connect polycrystalline microstructures to the statistically signified driving forces controlling the high cycle fatigue (HCF) responses. This is achieved through protocols that quantify these microstructures using 2-pt spatial correlations and represent them in a reduced-dimensional space using principal component analysis. Reduced-order relationships are then constructed to link microstructures to performance characteristics related to their HCF responses. These protocols are demonstrated for α-titanium, which exhibits heterogeneous microstructure features along with significant elastic and inelastic anisotropies at both the microscale and the macroscale.},

The model is developed for composites with a wide range of combinations of strain hardening laws and topologies of the constituents. The theoretical foundation of the model is inspired by statistical continuum theories, leveraged by mean-field approximation of self-consistent models, and calibrated to data obtained from micromechanical finite element simulations. The model also relies on newly formulated data-driven linkages between micromechanical responses (phase-average strain rates and effective strength) and microstructure as well as strength contrast of the constituents. The paper describes in detail the theoretical development of the model, its implementation into an efficient computational plasticity framework, calibration of the linkages, and demonstration of the model predictions on two-phase composites with isotropic constituents exhibiting linear and power-law strain hardening laws. It is shown that the model reproduces finite element results reasonably well with significant savings of the computational cost.},

This work investigates the viability of establishing low (computational) cost, data-driven, surrogate models for previously established numerical multiscale material models. This new approach comprises the following main steps: (1) generating a calibration (i.e., training) dataset using an ensemble of representative microstructures and obtaining their mechanical responses using established physics-based simulation tools (e.g., finite element models), (2) establishing objective, reduced-order, measures of the microstructures (e.g., using n-point spatial correlations and Principal Component Analysis), and (3) extracting and validating sufficiently accurate, computationally low-cost, relationships between the selected microstructure measures and effective (homogenized) properties (or performance metrics) of interest using various regression methods.

Quantification of the material structure (also referred as microstructure) is the core challenge in this task. Conventionally, microstructure quantification has been addressed using highly simplified measures suggested by the governing physics, with the list of measures often suitably augmented by the intuition of the materials expert. In this paper, we develop an objective (data-driven) approach to efficiently and accurately link a three-dimensional (3-D) microstructure to its effective (homogenized) properties. Our method employs a 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the salient features of the material microstructures that lead to good predictive performance for the effective property of interest. We then utilize 3-D CNN learned features as estimators of higher-order spatial correlations, and formulate an integrated framework combining 3-D CNN features with 2-point spatial correlations. In this work, we created an extremely large microstructure-property benchmark dataset of 5900 microstructures, and demonstrated that our CNN based approach not only learns interpretable microstructure features, but also leads to improved accuracy in property predictions for new microstructures, while achieving a dramatic reduction in the computation time.},

These include any problem which abstractly requires a comparison of each of the N points in a dataset with each other point and would naively be solved using N2 distance computations. In practice N is often large enough to make this infeasible. We present a suite of new geometric techniques which are applicable in principle to any 'N-body' computation including large-scale mixtures of Gaussians, RBF neural networks, and HMM's. Our algorithms exhibit favorable asymptotic scaling and are empirically several orders of magnitude faster than the naive computation, even for small datasets. We are aware of no exact algorithms for these problems which are more efficient either empirically or theoretically. In addition, our framework yields simple and elegant algorithms. It also permits two important generalizations beyond the standard all-point-pairs problems, which are more difficult. These are represented by our final examples, the multiple two-point correlation and the notorious n-point correlation.},

The presence of each of these types of porosity has been confirmed by both optical and SEM examination. In order to quantify the degree of porosity, two approaches have been used. For the case of void-like porosity, area fraction has been used; and, for crack-like porosity, the periodicity of the cracks and their lengths has been measured.

The temperature variation occurs via a parameter, γ, related to the conductivity of the pores. The effect of pore shape was determined via the axial ratio, ε, of oblate or prolate ellipsoidal pores. The results are presented graphically in curves showing the variation of β with γ and ε. The model was applied to actual conductivity data of ThO2 and ThO2-UO2 specimens in an effort to correlate the general porous structure typical of ceramic fuels to the parameters (ε and γ) in the Fricke equation. It was shown that the β factor for ceramic fuels can be related to their general microstructure and pore conductivity in a self-consistent mathematical framework. The technique, therefore, minimizes much of the guesswork heretofore required in estimating the porosity correction factor.
Résumé
Les variations du facteur de correction de la porosité β, avec la température et la forme des pores ont étéétudiées en utilisant l'équation de Fricke pour la conductivité thermique d'un milieu biphasé contenant la seconde phase sous forme d'ellipsoides distribués au hasard. La variation de température a lieu à l'aide d'un paramètre γ, relié à la conductivité des pores. L'effet de la forme des pores a été déterminé à partir du rapport des 2 axes ε des ellipses représentant la forme des pores. Les résultats sont représentés graphiquement sous forme de courbes montrant la variation de β en fonction de γ et ε. Le modèle a été appliqué pour donner les conductivités réelles d'échantillons de ThO2 et ThO2-UO2 en tenant de reiier la structure poreuse typique des combustibles céramiques aux paramètres ε et γ dans l'équation de Fricke. Il est ainsi montré que le facteur β pour les combustibles céramiques peut être relié à leur microstructure et à la conductivité des pores dans un modèle mathématique convenable. La technique minimise donc beaucoup l'importance des hypothèses requises jusqu'ici pour estimer le facteur de correction de la porosité.
Zusammenfassung
Abhängigkeit des Porositätskorrekturfaktors β von der Temperatur und der Porenform wird mit Hilfe der Frickeschen Gleichung für die Wärmeleitfähigkeit eines zweiphasigen Mediums untersucht, das die zweite Phase als statistisch verteilte Ellipsoide enthält. Die Temperaturabhängigkeit wird durch einen Parameter γ beschrieben, der sich auf die Leitfähigkeit der Poren bezieht. Der Einfluss der Porenform wird durch das Achsenverhältnis ε von abgeplatteten oder gestreckten ellipsoidischen Poren bestimmt. Die Ergebnisse werden graphisch dargestellt und zeigen die Abhängigkeit der Grosse β von γ und ε. Das Modell wurde auf vorliegende Leitfähigkeitswerto von ThO2- und ThO2-UO2-Proben angewendet, um die allgemeine Porenstruktur, die typisch für keramische Brennelemente ist, mit den Parametern ε und y der Frickeschen Gleichung zu korreliereri. Es wird durch eine widerspruchsfreie mathematische Theorie gezeigt, dass ein Zusammenhang zwischen dem Faktor β und der allgemeinen Mikrostruktur und Porenleitfähigkeit von keramischen Brennelementen besteht. Diese Methode verringert die bisher erforderlichen Annahmen, mit denen der Porositätskorrekturfaktor abgeschätzt wurde.},

A unified hybrid constitutive model is proposed for the through-thickness thermal conductivity prediction for the particle embedded woven fabric system, incorporating a combination of generalized rule of mixtures and Pilling model to address a wide range of particle volumes and particle and fiber thermal conductivities. The proposed model can be used as a simple guideline to estimate the through-thickness thermal conductivity of such three component composite structures with woven fabrics, particles and matrices.},

	abstract = {The relative shear moduli of composites containing glass spheres in a rubbery matrix obey the Mooney equation, analogous to the relative viscosity of similar suspensions in Newtonian liquids. However, when the matrix is a rigid epoxy, the relative shear moduli are less than what the Mooney equation predicts but greater than what the Kerner equation predicts. Relative moduli are less for rigid matrices than for rubbery matrices because (1) the modulus of the filler is not extremely greater compared to that of the rigid matrix; (2) Poisson's ratio is less than 0.5 for a rigid matrix; (3) thermal stresses in the matrix surrounding the particles reduce the apparent modulus of the polymer matrix because of the nonlinear stress—strain behavior of the matrix. This latter effect gives rise to a temperature dependence of the relative modulus below the glass transition temperature of the polymer matrix. Formation of strong aggregates increases the shear modulus the same as viscosity is increased by aggregation. Torsion or flexure tests on specimens made by casting or by molding give incorrect low values of moduli because of a surface layer containing an excess of matrix material; this gives rise to a fictitious increase in apparent modulus as particle size decreases. The mechanical damping can be markedly changed by surface treatment of the filler particles without noticeable changes in the modulus. The Kerner equation, which is a lower bound to the shear modulus, is modified and brought into closer aggrement with the experimental data by taking into account the maximum packing fraction of the filler particles.},

The H2L model includes the effects of fiber-matrix interfacial conductance, high-fiber packing fractions within individual tows, and the nonuniform nature of 2-D fabric/matrix layers that usually include a significant amount of interlayer porosity. Previously, H2L model keff predictions were compared to measured values for two versions of 2-D Hi-NicalonTM/pyrocarbon (PyC)/isothermal chemical vapor infiltration (ICVI)-SiC composite, one with a “thin” (0.11-mm) and the other with a “thick” (1.04-mm) PyC fiber coating, and for a 2-D TyrannoTM SA/thin PyC/forced flow chemical vapor infiltration SiC composite. In this study, H2L model keff predictions were compared to measured values for a 2-D SiCf /SiC composite made using the ICVI process with Hi-Nicalon type S fabric and a thin PyC fiber coating. The values of keff determined for the latter composite were significantly greater than the keff values determined for the composites made with either the Hi-Nicalon or the Tyranno SA fabrics. Differences in keff values were expected for the different fiber types, but major differences also were due to observed microstructural and architectural variations between the composite systems, and as predicted by the H2L model.},

In particular, when describing the elastic and electro-conductive properties of a strongly inhomogeneous two-phase composite material, the steep rise of eﬀective parameters occurs at diﬀerent concentrations. To achieve the logical concordance between the cross-property relations, a modiﬁcation of the eﬀective medium theory of the elastic properties is introduced. It is shown that the qualitative conclusions of the theory do not change, while a possibility of describing a broader class of composite materials with various percolation thresholds arises. It is determined under what conditions there is an elasticity theory analogue of the Dykhne formula for the eﬀective conductivity. The theoretical results are supported by known experiments and show improvement over the existing approach. The introduction of the theory with the variable percolation threshold paves the way for describing the magnetorheological properties of magnetoactive elastomers. A similar approach has been recently used for the description of magneto-dielectric and magnetic properties.},

Further, analytical models consisting of series-parallel thermal resistance networks are developed in order, to obtain orthotropic thermal conductivity. The numerical and analytical models are explicitly bused on the properties of the constituent materials and three-dimensional features of the weave style. Results obtained from the models are compared with experimental values and with models available in the literature. Non-linear mechanical constitutive behavior due to resin stress/strain non-linearity and to transverse yarn damage under in-plane uni-axial loads are also investigated.

	abstract = {Ceramic matrix composites are being considered as candidate materials for high temperature aircraft engine components to replace the current high density metal alloys. Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC) are engineered material composed of coated 2D woven high strength fiber tows and melt infiltrated ceramic matrix. Matrix voids are common defects generated during the melt infiltration process. The effects of these matrix voids are usually associated with a reduction in the initial overall composite stiffness, and a decrease in the thermal conductivity of the component. Furthermore, the role of the matrix as well as the coating is to protect the fibers from the harsh engine environment. Hence, the current design approach is to limit the design stress level of CMC components to be always below the first matrix cracking stress. In this study, the stress concentrations around observed macroscopic matrix voids are calculated using a combined NDE/Finite-Element Scheme. The Computed Tomography (CT) is utilized as the NDE method to characterize the initial macroscopic matrix void’s locations and sizes in a CMC tensile test specimen. The Finite Element is utilized to calculate the localized stress field around these voids based on the 2D CT images. The same specimen was also scanned after tensile testing to a maximum nominal stress of 150 MPa to depict any growth of the previous observed voids. The post test CT scans depicted an enlargement and some coalescence of the existing voids.},

	title = {Analyzing theoretical models for predicting thermal conductivity of composite materials for {LED} heat sink applications},
	abstract = {This study investigated the thermal properties of composite materials with respect to their potential to be used for thermal management in light-emitting diode (LED) application. The effect of filler particles size and volume fraction in the composite material thermal conductivity was investigated. Experimental data for copper-filled epoxy composites with copper particles of average size of 5-μm and 150-μm were compared to three theoretical models: Maxwell, LewisNielsen, and percolation theory. Our study shows that all three theoretical models underestimate the thermal conductivity compared to the experimental results for composites with 150-μm copper particles up to 0.54 filler volume fraction. In the filler volume fraction region that is of interest to LED thermal management applications, between 0.40 and 0.54, the percolation model underestimates the experimental data by {\textasciitilde}40\%, and the Lewis-Nielsen model underestimates by {\textasciitilde}67\%. However, the theoretical models show closer agreement with the experimental data for composites with 5-μm copper particles up to 0.51 filler volume fraction. The percolation model overestimates the experimental data by 18\% and the Lewis-Nielsen model underestimates by 12\%. According to the estimated values from the theoretical models, there is no filler particle size effect on the composite thermal conductivity. However, the experimental data show that the composites with 5-μm copper particles tend to have lower thermal conductivity than the composites with 150-μm copper particles.},

	abstract = {The physical model for tow behavior, developed previously by the authors, is used to study the performance of two woven CMC laminates: a carbon fiber/carbon–SiC matrix (C/C–SiC) plain weave laminate – DLR-XT; and a carbon fiber–carbon matrix (C/C) 8-Harness Satin weave laminate – HITCO. For both materials, room temperature stress–strain curves and transverse thermal conductivity–strain curves are available from a previous experimental investigation; these curves have been used as benchmarks to assess the fidelity of the models. The tow model has first been used to develop relationships for 0 /90  uni-directional unit cells, and then adapted to cater for unit cells of the DLR-XT and HITCO woven composites. For both materials, acceptable predictions have been made of stress–strain behavior. Despite the thermal models being based on one-dimensional heat flow, within series-parallel elements, excellent predictions have been made of the degradation in transverse composite thermal conductivity with the composite strain. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that the effect of the degradation of transverse thermal conductivity is due to strain-driven growth of wake debonded cracks.},

The SiC/SiC composites consisting of near-stoichiometric SiC ﬁbers, stoichiometric and fully crystalline SiC matrices, and the pyrocarbon (PyC) or multilayered PyC/SiC interphase between the ﬁber and the matrix are considered particularly resistant to very high radiation environments. This paper provides a summary compilation of the properties of these composites, speciﬁcally those with the chemically vapor-inﬁltrated (CVI) SiC matrices, including newly obtained results. The properties discussed are both in unirradiated condition and after neutron irradiation to intermediate ﬂuence levels (most data are for {\textless}\$10 displacement per atom) at 300–1300 °C.},
