I'm currently a doctoral candidate under advisement of [Dr. Surya R. Kalidindi](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/kalidindi) at the Georgia Institute of Technology focused primarily on fundamental and applied problems within computational material science. My work is centered around materials exploration and identifying novel structures to meet certain functional property targets through leveraging computational methods and machine learning in order to solve this high-dimensional inverse problem.
