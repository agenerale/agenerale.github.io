**Research:** '''I am currently a doctoral candidate under advisement of [Dr. Surya R. Kalidindi](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/kalidindi) in the [Mechanical Engineering Department]( https://www.me.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology.
My research primarily focuses upon materials exploration, with the ultimate goal of enabling stochastic, automated, data-driven exploration of microstructure, conditioned upon certain functional property targets.
This stochastic inverse problem is partially addressed through flow-based generative machine learning models alongside learned microstructure descriptor compression.
My research interests encompass broad aspects of probabilistic modeling, deep learning, microstructure-sensitive design, high-dimensional stochastic inverse problems, and their potential transformative impact on wider scientific fields.'''

**Previously:** Prior to returning to graduate school, I worked for several years in the aerospace industry, first in the fabrication of high-pressure turbine airfoils, and later in designing the internal cooling circuits of such airfoils for commercial and military applications.
