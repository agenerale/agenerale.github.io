I am currently a doctoral candidate under advisement of [Dr. Surya R. Kalidindi](https://www.me.gatech.edu/faculty/kalidindi) in the [Mechanical Engineering Department]( https://www.me.gatech.edu/) at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My research centers around materials exploration, with the stated goal of identifying novel material structures meeting certain functional property targets. This inverse problem is aided through the use of generative machine learning models in a stochastic, automated, data-driven exploration in order to provide conditional distributions of potential structures.
<p>My research interests encompass broad aspects of probabilistic modeling, deep learning, microstructure-sensitive design, high-dimensional inverse problems, and their transformative impact on wider scientific fields.</p>
<p>Prior to returning to graduate school, I worked for several years in the aerospace industry both fabricating high-pressure turbine airfoils as well as designing their internal cooling circuits to meet mission life targets.</p>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy trying out any sports (mostly cycling and tennis), traveling, and spending time outside with family.</p>
